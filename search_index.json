Summary and Description","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - API summary\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nWorkshop Summary\nThis workshop will cover many topics revolving around APIs.\nWhat is an API?\nApplication Programming Interface\n\nIn computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware or software library. An API specification can take many forms, but often includes specifications for routines, data structures, object classes, variables or remote calls. POSIX, Windows API and ASPI are examples of different forms of APIs. Documentation for the API is usually provided to facilitate usage.\n\nAn API can be thought of as a set of functionality that other developers can consume.\nWorkshop Topics\nIn this workshop we will go over the following topics:\n\nDefine REST as first described by Roy Fielding\nDiscuss Restful API Design\nGo over HTTP concepts\nDiscuss API Design Practices\nAPI Testing\nAPI Security\nAPI Description Languages\nGraphQL\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← README\nRestful API Introduction →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/restful-intro.html":{"url":"docs/restful-intro.html","title":"Restful API Introduction","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - Restful API Introduction\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nSoap\nSimple Object Access Protocol SOAP is a Protocol\nSoap uses (Extensible Markup Language (XML)) XML as its message format\nHypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP is the application protocol most used in SOAP services although Soap is not limited to HTTP.\nSOAP has three major characteristics:\n\nextensibility (security and WS-Addressing are among the extensions under development)\n\nneutrality because it can operate over any protocol\n\nHTTP\nSimple Mail Transfer SMTP\nTransmission Control Protocol TCP\nUser Datagram Protocol UDP\n\n\nindependence (SOAP allows for any programming model)\n\n\nThe SOAP architecture consists of several layers of specifications for:\n\nmessage format\nMessage Exchange Patterns (MEP)\nunderlying transport protocol bindings\nmessage processing models\nprotocol extensibility\n\nDisadvantages of Soap\nStandard implementations of SOAP utilize XML as the messaging format\nSoap is a verbose protocol and it is slower to parse XML than JSON\nDifferences between Soap and REST\nSoap is a protocol while Representational State Transfer (REST) is more of an architectural style\nSOAP is a well-developed protocol used in the Web industry and is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium W3C.\nRest is the culmination Roy Fieldings PHd Dissertation research\nRest does not a dictate a messaging format so you can in theory use xml, json, and text as message formats.\nModern Restful APIs use JSON as the message format\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← API Summary and Description\nRoy Fieldings Dissertation on REST →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/rest-dissertation.html":{"url":"docs/rest-dissertation.html","title":"Roy Fieldings Dissertation on REST","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - Rest Dissertation\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nRoy Fielding Abstract Quotes\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nMy  work  is motivated  by  the  desire  to  understand  and  evaluate  the  architectural  design  of  network-based  application  software  through  principled  use  of  architectural  constraints,  thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints.\n\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nThis  dissertation  defines  a  framework  for  understanding  software  architecture  viaarchitectural  styles  and  demonstrates  how  styles  can  be  used  to  guide  the  architecturaldesign  of  network-based  application  software.\n\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nA  good  architecture is  not  created  in  a  vacuum. All design decisions at  the architectural  level should  be made  within the context of  the  functional,  behavioral,  and social requirements of the system being designed, which is a principle that applies equally to  both  software  architecture and the  traditional  field  of  building  architecture.\n\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nThe hyperbole of The Architects Sketch may seem ridiculous, but consider how oftenwe see software projects begin with adoption of the latest fad in architectural design, and only  later  discover  whether  or  not  the  system  requirements  call  for  such  an  architecture.\n\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nThis  dissertation  explores  a  junction  on  the  frontiers  of  two  research  disciplines  in computer  science:  software  and  networking. \n\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nThe Web is intended to be an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, which means considerably more than just geographical dispersion. The Internet is about  interconnecting  information  networks  across  organizational  boundaries.  Suppliers of information services must be able to cope with the demands of anarchic scalability and the independent deployment of software components. Distributed hypermedia provides a uniform means of accessing services through the embedding of action controls within the presentation of information retrieved from remote sites. An architecture for the Web must therefore  be  designed  with  the  context  of  communicating  large-grain  data  objects  across high-latency networks and multiple trust boundaries.\n\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nThis work  was  done  in  conjunction  with  my  authoring  of  the  Internet  standards  for  the Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol  (HTTP)  and  Uniform  Resource  Identifiers  (URI),  the  two specifications that define the generic interface used by all component interactions on the Web.\n\nSummary of Dissertation via Roy Fielding\nIn  summary,  this  dissertation  makes  the  following  contributions  to  software  research within the field of Information and Computer Science:\n\na framework for understanding software architecture through architectural styles, including a consistent set of terminology for describing software architecture\n\na classification of architectural styles for network-based application software by the architectural properties they would induce when applied to the architecture for a distributed hypermedia system\n\nREST, a novel architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems\n\napplication and evaluation of the REST architectural style in the design and deployment of the architecture for the modern World Wide Web.\n\n\nChapter 1 - Software Architecture\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nA software architecture is an abstraction of the run-time elements of a software system during some phase of its operation. A system may be composed of many levels of abstraction and many phases of operation, each with its own software architecture.\n\nThis chapter goes into detail on what Software Architecture is. Discussion about software architecture patterns ensues.\nFielding goes into detail about the Gang of Four Design Patterns and expounds upon some of the choices that Object-Oriented Design patterns want to tackle.\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nIn  many  ways,  Alexander’s  patterns  have  more  in  common  with  software  architectural styles than the design patterns of OOPL research. An architectural style, as a coordinated set  of  constraints,  is  applied  to  a  design  space  in  order  to  induce  the  architectural properties that are desired of the system. By applying a style, an architect is differentiatingthe software design space in the hope that the result will better match the forces inherent in the  application,  thus  leading  to  system  behavior  that  enhances  the  natural  pattern  rather than conflicting with it.\n\nHere Roy is talking about Christopher Alexander who is a well known building architect. \nThis chapter provides terminology that set the stage for later chapters.\nCHAPTER 2 - Network-based Application Architectures\nThis chapter went over the framework of network-based application architectures.\nFielding explains network latency concepts and how the style of a network application architecture influences the performance of such architectures\nThere is great discussions on the following topics:\n\nScalability\nSimplicity\nModifiability\nVisibility\nPortability\nReliability\n\nThe overall premise of this chapter seems to point that architectural style influences architectural design\nCHAPTER 3 - Network-based Architectural Styles\nThis chapter discusses many different types of architectural styles in network-based architectures.\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nI  have  intentionally  excluded  styles  that  do  not  enhance  the  communication  or interaction properties when combined with one of the surveyed styles to form a network-based  application.  \n\nPipe and Filter styles is mentioned quite often in this chapter.\nA Pipe and Filter is a simple, yet powerful architecture. A pipe and filter consists of any number of components (filters) that transform or filter data, before passing it on via connectors (pipes) to other components. The filters are all working at the same time. The architecture is often used as a simple sequence, but it may also be used for very complex structures.\nThe most well known pipe and filter system is a Unix Program or in compilers.\nFielding discusses many different Hierarchical Network Styles such as Client Server, Layered Client Server and more.\nCHAPTER 4 - Designing the Web Architecture: Problems and Insights\nThis chapter describes in detail the early thoughts on how the World Wide Web (WWW) would be.\nAs its intent was to share documents with University Faculty and Government Employees in Physics Laboratories.\nFielding explains how no one predicted the explosive growth of the web and the impending interest with businesses.\nThe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) set out to form standardization committees for URI, HTTP, and HTML.\nFielding formulates 3 hypothesis:\n\nThe design rationale behind the WWW architecture can be described by an architectural style consisting of the set of constraints applied to the elements within the Web architecture.\n\nConstraints can be added to the WWW architectural style to derive a new hybrid style that better reflects the desired properties of a modern Web architecture.\n\nProposals to modify the Web architecture can be compared to the updated WWW architectural style and analyzed for conflicts prior to deployment.\n\n\nFielding explains how over the past 6 years as a PHD student he worked with many individiduals and committees to help formulate standards.\nRoy Fielding helped write much of HTTP 1.1 Specification\nHTTP 1.1 Specification\nCHAPTER 5 - Representational State Transfer (REST)\nFielding states the constraints of REST in this Chapter:\n\nClient - Server\n\nThe first constraints added to our hybrid style are those of the client-server architectural style.\nSeparation  of  concerns  is  the  principlebehind  the  client-server  constraints.  \nBy  separating  the  user  interface  concerns  from  the data  storage  concerns,  we  improve  the  portability  of  the  user  interface  across  multiple platforms  and  improve  scalability  by  simplifying  the  server  components.\n\n\nStateless\n\nCommunication must be stateless in  nature,  as  in  the  client-stateless-server  (CSS)  style, such that  each  request  from  client  to  server  must  contain  all  of  the  information  necessary  to understand  the  request,  and  cannot  take  advantage  of  any  stored  context  on  the  server.\nSession state is therefore kept entirely on the client.\n\nCache \n\nIn order to improve network efficiency, we add cache constraints to form the client-cache-stateless-server style.\nCache constraints require that the data within  a  response  to  a  request  be  implicitly  or  explicitly  labeled  as  cacheable  or  non-cacheable.  \nIf  a  response  is  cacheable,  then  a  client  cache  is  given  the  right  to  reuse  that response data for later, equivalent requests.\n\n\nUniform Interface\n\nThe  central  feature  that  distinguishes  the  REST  architectural  style  from  other  network-based styles is its emphasis on a uniform interface between components.\nBy applying the software engineering principle of generality to the component interface, the overall  system  architecture  is  simplified  and  the  visibility  of  interactions  is  improved.\n\n\nLayered System\n\nThe  layered  system  style allows  an  architecture  to  be  composed  of  hierarchical  layers  by  constraining  component behavior such that each component cannot \"see\" beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting. \nBy restricting knowledge of the system to a single layer, we place a bound on the overall system complexity and promote substrate independence.\n\n\nCode-On-Demand\n\nREST   allows   client   functionality   to   be   extended   by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts. \nThis simplifies clientsby reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented. \nAllowing features to be downloaded after deployment improves system extensibility. \nHowever, it also reduces visibility, and thus is only an optional constraint within REST\n\n\n\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nAll  REST  interactions  are  stateless.  That  is,  each  request  contains  all  of  theinformation  necessary  for  a  connector  to  understand  the  request,  independent  of  anyrequests  that  may  have  preceded  it.  This  restriction  accomplishes  four  functions:  1)  it removes  any  need  for  the  connectors  to  retain  application  state  between  requests,  thus reducing  consumption  of  physical  resources  and  improving  scalability;  2)  it  allows interactions  to  be  processed  in  parallel  without  requiring  that  the  processing  mechanism understand the interaction semantics; 3) it allows an intermediary to view and understand a request in isolation, which may be necessary when services are dynamically rearranged; and,  4)  it  forces  all  of  the  information  that  might  factor  into  the  reusability  of  a  cachedresponse to be present in each request.\n\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nREST  provides  a  set  of  architectural  constraints  that, when applied as a whole, emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces,  independent  deployment  of  components,  and  intermediary  components  to reduce  interaction  latency,  enforce  security,  and  encapsulate  legacy  systems.  I  described the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, while contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles\n\nCHAPTER 6 - Experience and Evaluation\nFielding spends a lot of the chapter discussing different experiences and impacts of REST.\n\"Fielding\":\n\nThe early Web architecture defined URI as document identifiers. Authors were instructed to  define  identifiers  in  terms  of  a  document’s  location  on  the  network.  Web  protocols could  then  be  used  to  retrieve  that  document.\n\n\"Fielding\":\n\nInformation hiding is one of the key software engineering principles that motivates the uniform  interface  of  REST.  Because  a  client  is  restricted  to  the  manipulation  of representations  rather  than  directly  accessing  the  implementation  of  a  resource,  the implementation  can  be  constructed  in  whatever  form  is  desired  by  the  naming  authority without  impacting  the  clients  that  may  use  its  representations.\n\n\"Fielding\":\n\nThe key problem areas in HTTP that were identified by REST included planning for the  deployment  of  new  protocol  versions,  separating  message  parsing  from  HTTP semantics and the underlying transport layer (TCP), distinguishing between authoritative and  non-authoritative  responses,  fine-grained  control  of  caching,  and  various  aspects  of the  protocol  that  failed  to  be  self-descriptive.\n\n\"Fielding\":\n\nHTTP does not support write-back caching. An HTTP cache cannot assume that what gets written through it is the same as what would be retrievable from a subsequent request for that  resource,  and  thus  it  cannot  cache  a  PUT  request  body  and  reuse  it  for  a  later  GET response. There are two reasons for this rule: 1) metadata might be generated behind-the-scenes, and 2) access control on later GET requests cannot be determined from the PUT request. However, since write actions using the Web are extremely rare, the lack of write-back caching does not have a significant impact on performance.\n\nFielding also lays some disadvantages of HTTP cookie usage and frames (i.e. iframes) in terms of security concerns and how they violate REST constraints.\nFielding also explains how Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions MIME was adopted by HTTP but how the message semantics don't line up well with the intentions of the WEB.\nFielding also explains the success of the Apache Project and how Apache became the first major implementor of the HTTP 1.1 Specification. Also notes its success as an open source project.\n\"Fielding\":\n\nA network-based API is an on-the-wire syntax, with defined semantics, for application interactions. A network-based API does not place any restrictions on the application code aside from the need to read/write to the network, but does place restrictions on the set of semantics  that  can  be  effectively  communicated  across  the  interface.  On  the  plus  side, performance   is   only   bounded   by   the   protocol   design   and   not   by   any   particular implementation of that design.\n\nFielding also makes some distinctions with HTTP with CORBA.\nFielding also differentiates RPC from HTTP.\nLastly Fielding explains why JavaScript is better suited for the web than Java.\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Restful API Introduction\nRest Architecture Constraints →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/rest-constraints.html":{"url":"docs/rest-constraints.html","title":"Rest Architecture Constraints","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - Rest Constraints\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nRest Constraints overview\nThere are 5 Constraints that the Rest style advocates:\n\nClient-Server\nStateless\nCache\nUniform Interface\nLayered System\nCode-On-Demand\n\nClient-Server\nThe server component provides a function or service to one or more clients.\nThe client can initiate requests for such services.\nServers are classified by the services they provide.\nFor example, a web server serves web pages and a file server serves files.\nSeparation of concerns is  the main principle behind the client-server model.\nBy separating the UI (the user interfaces) from the data storage we in turn gain portability of the UI across different platforms and improve scalability in the server components.\nThis separation of concerns helps the components evolve independently and thus helps support internet scale issues.\nStateless\nCommunication must be stateless in nature.\n\nEach  request  from the client to the server  must  contain  all  of  the  information  necessary  to understand the  request\n\nThe request cannot  take  advantage  of  any  stored  context  on  the  server.\n\nSession state is therefore kept entirely on the client.\n\n\nThe stateless constraint emphasizes visibility, reliability, and scalability.\nVisibility is improved because any monitoring sytem will not have to look beyond a single requet to determine the nature of the request.\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nReliability is improved because it eases the task of recovering from partial failures. Scalability is improved because not  having  to  store  state  between  requests  allows  the  server  component  to  quickly  free resources,  and  further  simplifies  implementation  because  the  server  doesn’t  have  to manage resource usage across requests.\n\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nLike most architectural choices, the stateless constraint reflects a design trade-off. The disadvantage is that it may decrease network performance by increasing the repetitive data(per-interaction overhead) sent in a series of requests, since that data cannot be left on the server  in  a  shared  context.  In  addition,  placing  the  application  state  on  the  client-side reduces  the  server’s  control  over  consistent  application  behavior,  since  the  application becomes  dependent  on  the  correct  implementation  of  semantics  across  multiple  clientversions.\n\nCache\nNetwork Efficiency is improved by adding cache constraints.\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nCache constraints require that the data within  a  response  to  a  request  be  implicitly  or  explicitly  labeled  as  cacheable  or  non-cacheable.  If  a  response  is  cacheable,  then  a  client  cache  is  given  the  right  to  reuse  that response data for later, equivalent requests.\n\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nThe advantage of adding cache constraints is that they have the potential to partially orcompletely  eliminate  some  interactions,  improving  efficiency,  scalability,  and  user-perceived  performance  by  reducing  the  average  latency  of  a  series  of  interactions.  The trade-off,  however,  is  that  a  cache  can  decrease  reliability  if  stale  data  within  the  cache differs significantly from the data that would have been obtained had the request been sent directly to the server.\n\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nThe  early  Web  architecture was defined by the client-cache-stateless-server set of constraints. That is, the design rationale presented  for  the  Web  architecture  prior  to  1994  focused  on  stateless  client-server interaction  for  the  exchange  of  static  documents  over  the  Internet.  The  protocols  for communicating  interactions  had  rudimentary  support  for  non-shared  caches,  but  did  not constrain the interface to a consistent set of semantics for all resources. Instead, the Web relied  on  the  use  of  a  common  client-server  implementation  library  (CERN  libwww)  to maintain consistency across Web applications. Developers  of  Web  implementations  had  already  exceeded  the  early  design.  In addition to static documents, requests could identify services that dynamically generated responses,  such  as  image-maps and  server-side  scripts.\n\nUniform Interface\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nThe  central  feature  that  distinguishes  the  REST  architectural  style  from  other  network-based styles is its emphasis on a uniform interface between components. By applying the software engineering principle of generality to the component interface, the overall  system  architecture  is  simplified  and  the  visibility  of  interactions  is  improved. Implementations  are  decoupled  from  the  services  they  provide,  which  encourages independent  evolvability.\n\nThe four constraints for a uniform interface are:\n\nIdentification of Resources\n\nIndividual resources are identified in requests, for example using URIs in Web-based REST systems.\n\n\nManipulation  of  resources  through  representations\n\nWhen a client holds a representation of a resource, including any metadata attached, it has enough information to modify or delete the resource.\n\n\nSelf-descriptive messages\n\nEach message includes enough information to describe how to process the message.\n\n\nHypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)\n\nA REST client should then be able to use server-provided links dynamically to discover all the available actions and resources it needs.\n\n\n\nLayered System\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nA layered  system style allows  an  architecture  to  be  composed  of  hierarchical  layers  by  constraining  component behavior such that each component cannot \"see\" beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting. By restricting knowledge of the system to a single layer, we place abound on the overall system complexity and promote substrate independence.\n\nA client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server, or to an intermediary along the way.\nIntermediary servers may improve system scalability by enabling load balancing and by providing shared caches.\nLayered System can also enforce security policies.\nCode-On-Demand\n\"Roy Fielding\":\n\nREST allows client functionality to be extended by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts. This simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented. Allowing features to be downloaded after deployment improves system extensibility. However, it also reduces visibility, and thus is only an optional constraint within REST.\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Roy Fieldings Dissertation on REST\nRichardson Maturity Model →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/maturity-model.html":{"url":"docs/maturity-model.html","title":"Richardson Maturity Model","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - Richardson Maturity Model\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nWhat is the Richardson Maturity Model (RMM)\nThe Richardson Maturity Model (RMM) was coined by Leonard Richardson\nLeonard Richardson gave a talk on QCon presenting this model\nRMM breaks down the maturity of Restful APIs into 4 levels:\n\nLevel 0\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 0\nLevel 0 lies on the realm of early web services.\nThese web services have the following:\n\nOne URI and one HTTP Method\n\nXML-RPC and SOAP Services\n\n\nLevel 1\nLevel 1 is many URIs and one HTTP method\nLevel 2\nLevel 2 consists of:\n\nMany URIs\nEach URI consisting of multiple HTTP Methods\nProper HTTP Status Codes\n\nIn this level you split out read operations, operations that want to fetch data, and treats them specially.\nGET /search?q=dogs\n\nHere we do a GET request where we want to search for dogs\nMost Restful APIs today are at level 2. \nThey have many URIs and they utilize a lot of the HTTP verbs:\n\nGET\nPOST\nPUT\nDELETE\nPATCH\n\nA lot of Earlier APIs mainly used GET and POST instead of breaking down operations into further semantic meaning like a PATCH or a DELETE verb would signify\nRichardson makes the point that XML-RPC only uses POST operations so you can't really utilize safe and idempotent operations like a GET request.\nEverything in XML-RPC is a POST request and you just wrap a response with the metainformation you need.\nLevel 3\nLevel 3 maturity is what Roy Fielding defines as a Restful API.\nIn this level you implement Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS)\nIt is easier for your clients to move from one resource to another if you embed the actual URIs in the HTTP response.\nRichardson uses Amazons S3 service as an example where you have to use the S3 key and then some rules to turn something into a URI.\nIf instead Amazon provided a URI in the response it would both help the client and Amazon provide more discoverability.\n\"Leonard Richardson\":\n\nConnections between resources are a form of data, and they should be described in the documents with the rest of the data.

A web browser, for example, may be the client and an application running on a computer hosting a website may be the server. The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.\nHTTP is an application layer protocol designed within the framework of the Internet protocol suite. Its definition presumes an underlying and reliable transport layer protocol, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is commonly used. However HTTP can be adapted to use unreliable protocols such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), for example in HTTPU and Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP).\nHTTP resources are identified and located on the network by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), using the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI's) schemes http and https. URIs and hyperlinks in HTML documents form inter-linked hypertext documents.\n\nHTTP Verbs\n\nHTTP defines methods (sometimes referred to as verbs) to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server.\n\nHTTP Status Codes\nThe HTTP response code designates the status of a particular operation for example a 200 for a successful GET request\nThe status code is the first line of the HTTP response and is called the status line and includes a numeric status code (such as \"404\") and a textual phrase (such as \"Not Found\").\nHTTP Request Message\nThe request message consists of the following:\n\nA request line (e.g., GET /user/1 HTTP/1.1, which requests a resource called /user/1 from the server).\n\nRequest header fields (e.g., Accept-Language: en).\n\nAn empty line.\n\nAn optional message body.\n\n\nHTTP Response Message\nThe response message consists of the following:\n\nA status line which includes the status code and reason message (for example HTTP/1.1 200 OK, which indicates that the client's request succeeded).\n\nResponse header fields (e.g., Content-Type: application/json).\n\nAn empty line.\n\nAn optional message body.\n\n\nHTTP session state\n\nHTTP is a stateless protocol. A stateless protocol does not require the HTTP server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests. However, some web applications implement states or server side sessions using for instance HTTP cookies or hidden variables within web forms.\n\nHTTP Parameters\nThere are four different types of HTTP parameters:\n\nPath parameters\nQuery parameters\nForm parameters\nHeader parameters.\n\nAll parameters are generally used to provide input to the API, but in practice each type is used in a different situation.\nPath Parameters\nA URL path is used to identify a resource. A path parameter is part of the URL and thus becomes part of the resource identifier.\nPath parameters are thus locators.\nMultiple path parameters are possible, but they will a tree structure.\nHierarchies can be well expressed by path parameters, but lists cannot be represented.\nhttps://domain.com/api/resource/{parameter-value1}/{parameter-value2}\nIf a path parameter is invalid, then the URL becomes invalid, as it does not identify a resource.\nAs a result, the resource cannot be found, and the status code 404 Not Found is returned.\nPath parameters can be used for any of the main HTTP methods such as GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc.\nQuery Parameters\nQuery parameters are key value pairs that are appended to the end of URL of a particular resource.\nMultiple query parameters can be concatenated, thus forming a list:\n​https://domain.com/api/resource?parameter1=value1&parameter2=value2\n\nIt is best practice to design query parameters as optional inputs for the API.\n\nEach query parameter may be provided or may be left out.\n\nIf a query parameter is not present, the API should be able to function without them or assume reasonable default values.\n\n\nIf a query parameter is an invalid identifier, the status code 400 Bad Request is returned.\nA status code of 404 Not Found should only be return if the underlying resource cannot be found.\nQuery parameters are usually used to do filtering, sorting, and/or projections and are used with the HTTP GET method.\nForm Parameters\nForm parameters are key-value pairs, where the key is the actual parameter name, and the value is the parameter value.\nForm parameters are used for data which has been collected in a HTML Form.\nForm parameters are used in combination with the HTTP POST method.\nForm parameters are transmitted in the HTTP Request Body.\nUnlike query parameters or path parameters, form parameters are not part of the URL.\nThe advantage of using form parameters is that they are not limited by the practical URL length limitations.\nYou need to set the HTTP Header when using Form Parameters to Content-Type :application/ x-www-form-urlencoded\nHere is an example Request:\nPOST https://domain.com/heroes  ​\n\nfirstname=Dark&lastname=Elf  ​\n\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-encoded  ​\n\n-> 201 Created\n\nHeader Parameters\nHeader parameters are key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the HTTP header and the value is the parameter value.\nHeader parameters are sent in the HTTP header, not in the HTTP body.\nHeader parameters are used in both requests and responses.\nHeader parameters are usually used for metadata.\nHeader parameters provide information on how to process the request or response without having to analyze the payload in the HTTP body.\nHeader parameters are sometimes also called HTTP header fields or simply HTTP headers.\nHTTP encryption\nThe most popular way of establishing an encrypted HTTP connection is HTTP Secure or HTTPS\nThere are two other methods for establishing an encrypted HTTP connection:\n\nSecure Hypertext Transfer Protocol\n\nHTTP/1.1 Upgrade header to specify an upgrade to TLS.\n\n\nThere is limited browser support for these so beware\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Richardson Maturity Model\nHTTP Verbs →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/http-verbs.html":{"url":"docs/http-verbs.html","title":"HTTP Verbs","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - HTTP Verbs\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nWhat are HTTP methods?\nHTTP Methods\nHTTP defines methods which are sometimes called HTTP verbs which indicate an action that is to be performed on a identified resource.\n\nWhat this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server.\n\nThe resource can correspond to a specific file on a server or can even be the output of an executable on a server.\nThe HTTP 1.0 specification specified the following HTTP methods:\n\nGET\nPOST\nHEAD\n\nYou can read more about this in RFC 1945 Section 8.1\nThe HTTP 1.1 specification added 5 new methods:\n\nOPTIONS\nPUT\nDELETE\nTRACE\nCONNECT\n\nYou can read more about this in RFC 2616 Section 9\nSince these methods are specified in RFC 1945 and RFC 2616 the semantics of these HTTP methods are well known and can be depended on. \nAny client can use any method and the server can be configured to support any combination of methods.\nIf a method is an unknown to an intermediate server then it will treated as an unsafe and non-idempotent method\nThere is no limit to the number of methods that can be defined and this allows for future methods to be specified without breaking existing infrastructure.\nFor instance RFC 5789 specified the PATCH method.\nSafe HTTP Method\nThe following HTTP Methods are considerd safe:\n\nGET\nHEAD\nOPTIONS\nTRACE\n\nAn HTTP method is considered safe if it is only intended for information retrieval and does not change the state of the server.\nIdempotent Method\nIdempotence\n\nIdempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science that they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application\n\nHTTP Methods have the property of \"idempotence\" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request.\nIdempotence in HTTP Methods\n\n(note that idempotence refers to the state of the system after the request has completed, so while the action the server takes (e.g. deleting a record) or the response code it returns may be different on subsequent requests, the system state will be the same every time\n\nIn this sense PUT and DELETE HTTP methods are idempotent even though multiple calls can return a different HTTP response code. \nFor example calling a resource such as DELETE/users/:idcould return204status code on first operation and then a404` on the second and subsequent requests.\nThe following HTTP methods are idempotent:\n\nGET\nHEAD\nPUT\nDELETE\nOPTIONS\nTRACE\n\nHTTP Method Summary Table\n\n\n\nHTTP Method\nRFC\nHas Request Body\nHas Response Body\nSafe\nIdempotent\nCacheable\n\n\n\n\nGET\nRFC 2616\nOptional\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nHEAD\nRFC 2616\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nPOST\nRFC 2616\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\nPUT\nRFC 2616\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\n\n\nDELETE\nRFC 2616\nNo\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\n\n\nCONNECT\nRFC 2616\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\nOPTIONS\nRFC 2616\nOptional\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nTRACE\nRFC 2616\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nPATCH\nRFC 2616\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\n\n\n\nOPTIONS HTTP Method\nOPTIONS HTTP Method\n\nThe OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI. \n\nThis method allows the client to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action or initiating a resource retrieval.\n\n\n\nThe OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for the specified URL. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource.\n\nHTTP Response Codes\nRFC 7231 Section 6.3.1\nTypically a 200 (OK) status code is used with a OPTIONS request.\n\nThe 200 (OK) status code indicates that the request has succeeded.\n\nHTTP Response Payloads\nTypically an OPTIONS is a representation of the communications options like the HTTP verbs used for the particular resource\nExample OPTIONS request\ncurl -X OPTIONS http://example.org -i\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nAllow: OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, POST\nCache-Control: max-age=604800\nDate: Sun, 25 Feb 2018 14:56:31 GMT\nExpires: Sun, 04 Mar 2018 14:56:31 GMT\nServer: EOS (vny006/0452)\nContent-Length: 0\n\nGET HTTP Method\nGET HTTP Method\n\nThe GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process. \nThe GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.\n\nHTTP Response Codes\nRFC 7231 Section 6.3.1\nTypically a 200 (OK) status code is used with a GET request.\n\nThe 200 (OK) status code indicates that the request has succeeded.\n\nHTTP Response Payloads\nFor a GET request the payload will be a representation of the target resource\nExample GET Request\nHere is a GET request from github that lists all users, in the order that they signed up on GitHub. This list includes personal user accounts and organization accounts.\nGET /users\n\nStatus: 200 OK\nLink: ; rel=\"next\"\n\n[\n  {\n    \"login\": \"octocat\",\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"avatar_url\":

\"site_admin\": false\n  }\n]\n\nHEAD HTTP Method\nHEAD HTTP Method\n\nThe HEAD method is identical to GET except that the server MUST NOT return a message-body in the response. \n\nThe metainformation contained in the HTTP headers in response to a HEAD request SHOULD be identical to the information sent in response to a GET request. \n\nThis method can be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the request without transferring the entity-body itself. \n\nThis method is often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility, and recent modification.\n\n\nHTTP Response Codes\nRFC 7231 Section 6.3.1\nTypically a 200 (OK) status code is used with a GET request.\n\nThe 200 (OK) status code indicates that the request has succeeded.\n\nHTTP Response Payloads\nFor a HEAD request you get the same representation as GET, but without the representation data.\nThis means you cannot send a message body with HEAD request, you only get the HTTP Response Headers sent back.\nExample HEAD Request\ncurl -X HEAD http://example.org/index.html -I\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nCache-Control: max-age=604800\nContent-Type: text/html\nDate: Sun, 25 Feb 2018 15:06:38 GMT\nEtag: \"1541025663+gzip\"\nExpires: Sun, 04 Mar 2018 15:06:38 GMT\nLast-Modified: Fri, 09 Aug 2013 23:54:35 GMT\nServer: ECS (dca/53DB)\nX-Cache: HIT\nContent-Length: 606\n\nPOST HTTP Method\nPOST HTTP Method\n\nThe POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.\n\nPOST is designed to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:\n\nAnnotation of existing resources\n\nPosting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or similar group of articles\n\nProviding a block of data, such as the result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process\n\nExtending a database through an append operation.\n\n\nHTTP Response Codes\nRFC 7231 Section 6.3.1\nA 200 (OK) status code is used with a POST request to denote a successful operation.\n\nThe 200 (OK) status code indicates that the request has succeeded.\n\nRFC 7231 Section 6.3.2\nA 201 (CREATED) status code indicates that a new resource has been created\nHTTP Response Payloads\nA 200 response code you will get a message body\nA 201 response code you will get a message body\nMore response codes are applicable please consult RFC 7231 Section 6.1\nExample POST

enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. \n\nIf the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. \n\nIf the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI. \n\nIf a new resource is created, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the 201 (Created) response. \n\nIf an existing resource is modified, either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate successful completion of the request. \n\nIf the resource could not be created or modified with the Request-URI, an appropriate error response SHOULD be given that reflects the nature of the problem.\n\nThe recipient of the entity MUST NOT ignore any Content-* (e.g. Content-Range) headers that it does not understand or implement and MUST return a 501 (Not Implemented) response in such cases.\n\n\nDifference between POST and PUT HTTP Methods\n\nThe fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is\n reflected in the different meaning of the Request-URI. \n\nThe URI in a POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed\n entity. \n\nThat resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations.\n\nIn contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource.\n\nIf the server desires that the request be applied to a different URI, it MUST send a 301 (Moved Permanently) response; the user agent MAY then make its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the request.\n\n\nHTTP Response Codes\nRFC 7231 Section 6.3.1\nA 200 (OK) status code is used with a PUT request to denote a successful operation.\nRFC 7231 Section 6.3.2\nA 201 (CREATED) status code indicates that a new resource has been created\nHTTP Response Payloads\nA 200

\"default\": true\n    }\n]\n\nDELETE HTTP Method\nDELETE HTTP Method\n\nThe DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource identified by the Request-URI. \n\nThis method MAY be overridden by human intervention (or other means) on the origin server. \n\nThe client cannot be guaranteed that the operation has been carried out, even if the status code returned from the origin server indicates that the action has been completed successfully. \n\nHowever, the server SHOULD NOT indicate success unless, at the time the response is given, it intends to delete the resource or move it to an inaccessible location.\n\n\nA successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an entity describing the status, 202 (Accepted) if the action has not yet been enacted, or 204 (No Content) if the action has been enacted but the response does not include an entity.\nHTTP Response Codes\nRFC 7231 Section 6.3.1\nA 200 (OK) status code is used with a PUT request to denote a successful operation.\nRFC 7231 Section 6.3.5\nA 204 (NO CONTENT) status code indicates indicates that the server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body.\nHTTP Response Payloads\nA 200 response code you will get a message body\nA 204 response code you will not get a message body\nExample DELETE Request\ncurl -X delete \\\n  https://api.github.com/repos/jbelmont/api-workshop/issues/4/labels/duplicate \\\n  -H 'Authorization: token aToken' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n\nThis will return a 200 status code and the following JSON payload:\n[\n    {\n        \"id\": 812066655,\n        \"url\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/jbelmont/api-workshop/labels/enhancement\",\n        \"name\": \"enhancement\",\n        \"color\": \"a2eeef\",\n        \"default\": true\n    }\n]\n\nTRACE HTTP Method\nTRACE HTTP Method\n\nThe TRACE method is used to invoke a remote, application-layer loop-vback of the request message. \n\nThe final recipient of the request SHOULD reflect the message received back to the client as the entity-body of a 200 (OK) response. \n\nThe final recipient is either the origin server or the first proxy or gateway to receive a Max-Forwards value of zero (0) in the request (see section 14.31). \n\nA TRACE request MUST NOT include an entity.\n\n\nHTTP Response Codes\nRFC 7231 Section 6.3.1\nA 200 (OK) status code is used with a PUT request to denote a successful operation.\nRFC 7231 Section 6.5.5\nThe 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code indicates that the method received in the request-line is known by the origin server but not supported by the target resource. \nThe origin server MUST generate an Allow header field in a 405 response containing a list of the target resource's currently supported methods.\nExample TRACE request\ncurl --insecure -v -X TRACE https://www.google.com/ -i\n\nThis will return a 405 status code (NOT ALLOWED)\nCONNECT HTTP Method\nCONNECT HTTP Method\nThis specification reserves the method name CONNECT for use with a proxy that can dynamically switch to being a tunnel (e.g. SSL tunneling [44])\n\nThe CONNECT method converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy\n\nRead more about this in HTTP Connect Tunneling in Wikipedia\nExample Connect Request\ncurl --insecure -X CONNECT curl.haxx.se -v -i\n\nHas the following output:\n* Rebuilt URL to: curl.haxx.se/\n*   Trying 2a04:4e42:2f::561...\n* TCP_NODELAY set\n* Connected to curl.haxx.se (2a04:4e42:2f::561) port 80 (#0)\n> CONNECT / HTTP/1.1\n> Host: curl.haxx.se\n> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0\n> Accept: */*\n>\n\nPATCH HTTP Method\nPATCH HTTP Method\n\nThe PATCH method requests that a set of changes described in the request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-URI.  \n\nThe set of changes is represented in a format called a \"patch document\" identified by a media type.  \n\nIf the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, the server MAY create a new resource, depending on the patch document type (whether it can logically modify a null resource) and permissions, etc.\n\nThe difference between the PUT and PATCH requests is reflected in the way the server processes the enclosed entity to modify the resource identified by the Request-URI.  \n\nIn a PUT request, the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced.  \n\nWith PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version.  \n\nThe PATCH method affects the resource identified by the Request-URI, and italso MAY have side effects on other resources; i.e., new resources may be created, or existing ones modified, by the application of a PATCH.\n\n\nHTTP Response Codes\nRFC 7231 Section 6.3.1\nA 200 (OK) status code is used with a PUT request to denote a successful operation.\nRFC 7231 Section

Codes","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - HTTP Status Codes\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nResponse Status Code\nResponse Status Codes RFC 7231\n\nThe status-code element is a three-digit integer code giving the result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request.\n\n\nHTTP status codes are extensible.  \n\nHTTP clients are not required to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such understanding is obviously desirable.  \n\nHowever, a client MUST understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first digit, and treat an unrecognized status code as being equivalent to the x00 status code of that class, with the exception that a recipient MUST NOT cache a response with an unrecognized status code.\n\n\n\nFor example, if an unrecognized status code of 471 is received by a client, the client can assume that there was something wrong with its request and treat the response as if it had received a 400 (Bad Request) status code.  The response message will usually contain a representation that explains the status.\n\nThe first digit of the status-code defines the class of response.\nThe last two digits do not have any categorization role.  \nThere are five values for the first digit:\n\n1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process\n\n2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted\n\n3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request\n\n4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled\n\n5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request\n\n\n1xx (Informational)\n1xx RFC 7231\n\nThe 1xx (Informational) class of status code indicates an interim response for communicating connection status or request progress prior to completing the requested action and sending a final response. \n\n1xx responses are terminated by the first empty line after the status-line (the empty line signaling the end of the header section).\n\nSince HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status codes, a server MUST NOT send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client.\n\nA client MUST be able to parse one or more 1xx responses received prior to a final response, even if the client does not expect one. \n\nA user agent MAY ignore unexpected 1xx responses.\n\nA proxy MUST forward 1xx responses unless the proxy itself requested the generation of the 1xx response.  \n\nFor example, if a proxy adds an \"Expect: 100-continue\" field when it forwards a request, then it need not forward the corresponding 100 (Continue) response(s).\n\n\n100 Continue\nThe server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body.\n101 Switching protocols\nThe requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server is acknowledging that it will do so.\n102 Processing\nThe server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.\n2xx (Successful)\n2xx RFC 7231\n\nThe 2xx (Successful) class of status code indicates that the client's request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.\n\n200 OK\nThe standard response for successful HTTP requests.\n201 Created\nThe request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created.\n202 Accepted\nThe request has been accepted but has not been processed yet. This code does not guarantee that the request will process successfully.\n203 Non-authoritative information\nHTTP 1.1. The server successfully processed the request but is returning information from another source.\n204 No content\nThe server accepted the request but is not returning any content. This is often used as a response to a DELETE request.\n205 Reset content\nSimilar to a 204 No Content response but this response requires the requester to reset the document view.\n206 Partial content\nThe server is delivering only a portion of the content, as requested by the client via a range header.\n207 Multi-status\nThe message body that follows is an XML message and can contain a number of separate response codes, depending on how many sub-requests were made.\nWebDAV - RFC 4918\n208 Already reported\nThe members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a previous reply to this request, and are not being included again.\nWebDAV - RFC 5842\n226 IM used\nThe server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.\n3xx (Redirection)\n3xx RFC 7231\nThe 3xx (Redirection) class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request.\n\nIf a Location header field (Section 7.1.2) is provided, the user agent MAY automatically redirect its request to the URI referenced by the Location field value, even if the specific status code is not understood. \n\nAutomatic redirection needs to done with care for methods not known to be safe, as defined in Section 4.2.1, since the user might not wish to redirect an unsafe request.\n\n\nThere are several types of redirects:\n\nRedirects that indicate the resource might be available at a different URI, as provided by the Location field, as in the status codes 301 (Moved Permanently), 302 (Found), and 307 (Temporary Redirect).\n\nRedirection that offers a choice of matching resources, each capable of representing the original request target, as in the 300 (Multiple Choices) status code.\n\nRedirection to a different resource, identified by the Location field, that can represent an indirect response to the request, as in the 303 (See Other) status code.\n\nRedirection to a previously cached result, as in the 304 (Not Modified) status code.\n\n\n300 Multiple choices\nThere are multiple options that the client may follow.\n301 Moved permanently\nThe resource has been moved and all further requests should reference its new URI.\n302 Found\nThe HTTP 1.0 specification described this status as \"Moved Temporarily\", but popular browsers respond to this status similar to behavior intended for 303. The resource can be retrieved by referencing the returned URI.\n303 See other\nThe resource can be retrieved by following other URI using the GET method. When received in response to a POST, PUT, or DELETE, it can usually be assumed that the server processed the request successfully and is sending the client to an informational endpoint.\n304 Not modified\nThe resource has not been modified since the version specified in If-Modified-Since or If-Match headers. The resource will not be returned in response body.\n305 Use proxy\nHTTP 1.1. The resource is only available through a proxy and the address is provided in the response.\n306 Switch proxy\nDeprecated in HTTP 1.1. Used to mean that subsequent requests should be sent using the specified proxy.\n307 Temporary redirect\nHTTP 1.1. The request should be repeated with the URI provided in the response, but future requests should still call the original URI.\n308 Permanent redirect\nExperimental. The request and all future requests should be repeated with the URI provided in the response. The HTTP method is not allowed to be changed in the subsequent request.\n308 Resume Incomplete (Google)\nThis code is used in the Resumable HTTP Requests Proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests\n4xx (Client Error)\n4xx RFC 7231\n\nThe 4xx (Client Error) class of status code indicates that the client seems to have erred.  \n\nExcept when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD send a representation containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. \n\nThese status codes are applicable to any request method. \n\nUser agents SHOULD display any included representation to the user.\n\n\n400 Bad request\nThe request could not be fulfilled due to the incorrect syntax of the request.\n401 Unauthorized\nThe requester is not authorized to access the resource. This is similar to 403 but is used in cases where authentication is expected but has failed or has not been provided.\n402 Payment required\nReserved for future use. Some web services use this as an indication that the client has sent an excessive number of requests.\n403 Forbidden\nThe request was formatted correctly but the server is refusing to supply the requested resource. Unlike 401, authenticating will not make a difference in the server's response.\n404 Not found\nThe resource could not be found. This is often used as a catch-all for all invalid URIs requested of the server.\n405 Method not allowed\nThe resource was requested using a method that is not allowed. For example, requesting a resource via a POST method when the resource only supports the GET method.\n406 Not acceptable\nThe resource is valid, but cannot be provided in a format specified in the Accept headers in the request.\n407 Proxy authentication required\nAuthentication is required with the proxy before requests can be fulfilled.\n408 Request timeout\nThe server timed out waiting for a request from the client. The client is allowed to repeat the request.\n409 Conflict\nThe request cannot be completed due to a conflict in the request parameters.\n410 Gone\nThe resource is no longer available at the requested URI and no redirection will be given.\n411 Length required\nThe request did not specify the length of its content as required by the resource.\n412 Precondition failed\nThe server does not meet one of the preconditions specified by the client.\n413 Request entity too large\nThe request is larger than what the server is able to process.\n414 Request-URI too long\nThe URI provided in the request is too long for the server to process. This is often used when too much data has been encoded into the URI of a GET request and a POST request should be used instead.\n415 Unsupported media type\nThe client provided data with a media type that the server does not support.\n416 Requested range not satisfiable\nThe client has asked for a portion of the resource but the server cannot supply that portion.\n417 Expectation failed\nThe server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field.\n418 I'm a teapot\nAny attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error code \"418 I'm a teapot\". The resulting entity body MAY be short and stout.\nHTCPCP - RFC 2324\n421 Misdirected request\nThe request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of scheme and authority that are included in the request URI.\nHTTP/2 - RFC 7540\n422 Unprocessable entity\nThe request was formatted correctly but cannot be processed in its current form. Often used when the specified parameters fail validation errors.\nWebDAV - RFC 4918\n423 Locked\nThe requested resource was found but has been locked and will not be returned.\nWebDAV - RFC 4918\n424 Failed dependency\nThe request failed due to a failure of a previous request.\nWebDAV - RFC 4918\n426 Upgrade required\nThe client should repeat the request using an upgraded protocol such as TLS 1.0.\n428 Precondition required\nThe origin server requires the request to be conditional.\nAdditional HTTP Status Codes - RFC 6585\n429 Too many requests\nThe user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\"rate limiting\").\nAdditional HTTP Status Codes - RFC 6585\n431 Request header fields too large\nThe server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large.\nAdditional HTTP Status Codes - RFC 6585\n440 Login Timeout (Microsoft)\nA Microsoft extension. Indicates that your session has expired.\n444 No Response (Nginx)\nUsed in Nginx logs to indicate that the server has returned no information to the client and closed the connection (useful as a deterrent for malware).\n449 Retry With (Microsoft)\nA Microsoft extension. The request should be retried after performing the appropriate action.\n450 Blocked by Windows Parental Controls (Microsoft)\nA Microsoft extension. This error is given when Windows Parental Controls are turned on and are blocking access to the given webpage.\n451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons\nA server operator has received a legal demand to deny access to a resource or to a set of resources that includes the requested resource.\nThe code 451 was chosen as a reference to the 1953 dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451, where books are outlawed.\nAn HTTP Status Code to Report Legal Obstacles - RFC 7725\n451 Redirect (Microsoft)\nUsed in Exchange ActiveSync if there either is a more efficient server to use or the server cannot access the users' mailbox.\n494 Request Header Too Large (Nginx)\nNginx internal code similar to 431 but it was introduced earlier in version 0.9.4 (on January 21, 2011).\n495 Cert Error (Nginx)\nNginx internal code used when SSL client certificate error occurred to distinguish it from 4XX in a log and an error page redirection.\n496 No Cert (Nginx)\nNginx internal code used when client didn't provide certificate to distinguish it from 4XX in a log and an error page redirection.\n497 HTTP to HTTPS (Nginx)\nNginx internal code used for the plain HTTP requests that are sent to HTTPS port to distinguish it from 4XX in a log and an error page redirection.\n498 Token expired/invalid (Esri)\nReturned by ArcGIS for Server. A code of 498 indicates an expired or otherwise invalid token.\n499 Client Closed Request (Nginx)\nUsed in Nginx logs to indicate when the connection has been closed by client while the server is still processing its request, making server unable to send a status code back.\n499 Token required (Esri)\nReturned by ArcGIS for Server. A code of 499 indicates that a token is required (if no token was submitted).\n5xx (Server Error)\n5xx RFC 7231\n\nThe 5xx (Server Error) class of status code indicates that the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the requested method.  \n\nExcept when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD send a representation containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. \n\nA user agent SHOULD display any included representation to the user.  \n\n\nThese response codes are applicable to any request method.\n500 Internal server error\nA generic status for an error in the server itself.\n501 Not implemented\nThe server cannot respond to the request. This usually implies that the server could possibly support the request in the future — otherwise a 4xx status may be more appropriate.\n502 Bad gateway\nThe server is acting as a proxy and did not receive an acceptable response from the upstream server.\n503 Service unavailable\nThe server is down and is not accepting requests.\n504 Gateway timeout\nThe server is acting as a proxy and did not receive a response from the upstream server.\n505 HTTP version not supported\nThe server does not support the HTTP protocol version specified in the request.\n506 Variant also negotiates\nTransparent content negotiation for the request results in a circular reference.\n507 Insufficient storage\nThe user or server does not have sufficient storage quota to fulfill the request.\nWebDAV - RFC 4918\n508 Loop detected\nThe server detected an infinite loop in the request.\nWebDAV - RFC 5842\n509 Bandwidth Limit Exceeded (Apache bw/limited extension)\nThis status code is not specified in any RFCs.

However, new or experimental header fields MAY be given the semantics of request-header fields if all parties in the communication recognize them to be request-header fields. \n\nUnrecognized header fields are treated as entity-header fields.\nAn entity header is an HTTP header describing the content of the body of the message. \nEntity headers are used in both, HTTP requests and responses. \nHeaders like Content-Length, Content-Language, Content-Encoding are entity headers.\nList of Request Header Fields\n\n\n\nHeader Field Name\nDescription\nExample\nRFC Reference\n\n\n\n\nAccept\nThe Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media types which are acceptable for the response. Accept headers can be used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.\nAccept: text/plain\nRFC 2616 Section 14.1\n\n\nAccept-Charset\nThe Accept-Charset request-header field can be used to indicate what character sets are acceptable for the response. This field allows clients capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-purpose character sets to signal that capability to a server which is capable of representing documents in those character sets.\nAccept-Charset: utf-8\nRFC 2616 Section\n\n\nAccept-Encoding\nThe Accept-Encoding request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the content-codings that are acceptable in the response.\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nRFC 2616 Section\n\n\nAccept-Language\nThe Accept-Language request-header field is similar to Accept, but restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to the request.\nAccept-Language: en-US\nRFC 2616 Section 14.4\n\n\nAuthorization\nA user agent that wishes to authenticate itself with a server--usually, but not necessarily, after receiving a 401 response--does so by including an Authorization request-header field with the request. The Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the realm of the resource being requested.\nAuthorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nRFC 2616 Section 14.8\n\n\nExpect\nThe Expect request-header field is used to indicate that particular server behaviors are required by the client.\nExpect: 100-continue\nRFC 2616 14.20\n\n\nFrom\nThe From request-header field, if given, SHOULD contain an Internete-mail address for the human user who controls the requesting user agent. The address SHOULD be machine-usable, as defined by \"mailbox\" in RFC 822 as updated by RFC 1123\nFrom: user@example.com\nRFC 2622 Section 14.22\n\n\nHost\nThe Host request-header field specifies the Internet host and port number of the resource being requested, as obtained from the original URI given by the user or referring resource. The Host field value MUST represent the naming authority of the origin server or gateway given by the original URL. This allows the origin server or gateway to differentiate between internally-ambiguous URLs, such as the root \"/\" URL of a server for multiple host names on a single IP address.\nHost: www.owasp.org\nRFC 2616 Section 14.23\n\n\nIf-Match\nThe If-Match request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. A client that has one or more entities previously obtained from the resource can verify that one of those entities is current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the If-Match header field.\nIf-Match: \"737060cd8c284d8af7ad3082f209582d\"\nRFC 2616 Section 14.24\n\n\nIf-Modified-Since\nThe If-Modified-Since request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional: if the requested variant has not been modified since the time specified in this field, an entity will not be returned from the server; instead, a 304 (not modified) response will be returned without any message-body.\nIf-Modified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT\nRFC 2616 Section 14.25\n\n\nIf-None-Match\nThe If-None-Match request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. A client that has one or more entities previously obtained from the resource can verify that none of those entities is current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the If-None-Match header field. The purpose of this feature is to allow efficient updates of cached information with a minimum amount of transaction overhead. It is also used to prevent a method (e.g. PUT) from inadvertently modifying an existing resource when the client believes that the resource does not exist.\nIf-None-Match: \"737060cd8c284d8af7ad3082f209582d\"\nRFC 2616 Section 14.26\n\n\nIf-Range\nIf a client has a partial copy of an entity in its cache, and wishes to have an up-to-date copy of the entire entity in its cache, it could use the Range request-header with a conditional GET (using either or both of If-Unmodified-Since and If-Match.) However, if the condition fails because the entity has been modified, the client would then have to make a second request to obtain the entire current entity-body.\nIf-Range: \"737060cd8c284d8af7ad3082f209582d\"\nRFC 2616 Section 14.27\n\n\nIf-Unmodified-Since\nThe If-Unmodified-Since request-header field is used with a method to make it conditional. If the requested resource has not been modified since the time specified in this field, the server SHOULD perform the requested operation as if the If-Unmodified-Since header were not present.\nIf-Unmodified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT\nRFC 2616 Section 14.28\n\n\nMax-Forwards\nThe Max-Forwards request-header field provides a mechanism with the TRACE and OPTIONS  methods to limit the number of proxies or gateways that can forward the request to the next inbound server. This can be useful when the client is attempting to trace a request chain which appears to be failing or looping in mid-chain.\nMax-Forwards: 10\nRFC 2616 Section 14.31\n\n\nProxy-Authorization\nThe Proxy-Authorization request-header field allows the client to identify itself (or its user) to a proxy which requires authentication. The Proxy-Authorization field value consists of credentials containing the authentication information of the user agent for the proxy and/or realm of the resource being requested.\nProxy-Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nRFC 2616 Section 14.34\n\n\nRange\nRequest only part of an entity. Bytes are numbered from 0\nRange: bytes=500-999\nRFC 2616 Section 14.35\n\n\nReferer\nThe Referer[sic] request-header field allows the client to specify, for the server's benefit, the address (URI) of the resource from which the Request-URI was obtained (the \"referrer\", although the header field is misspelled.) The Referer request-header allows a server to generate lists of back-links to resources for interest, logging, optimized caching, etc. It also allows obsolete or mistyped links to be traced for maintenance. The Referer field MUST NOT be sent if the Request-URI was obtained from a source that does not have its own URI, such as input from the user keyboard.\nReferer: https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLpr-xdpM8wG9g8l21uzfgyx4xAJ9aY7e7&\nRFC 2616 Section 14.36\n\n\nTE\nThe TE request-header field indicates what extension transfer-codings it is willing to accept in the response and whether or not it is willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding. Its value may consist of the keyword \"trailers\" and/or a comma-separated list of extension transfer-coding names with optional accept parameters\nTE: trailers, deflate\nRFC 2616 Section 14.39\n\n\nUser-Agent\nThe User-Agent request-header field contains information about the user agent originating the request. This is for statistical purposes, the tracing of protocol violations, and automated recognition of user agents for the sake of tailoring responses to avoid particular user agent limitations. User agents SHOULD include this field with requests. The field can contain multiple product tokens (section 3.8) and comments identifying the agent and any subproducts which form a significant part of the user agent. By convention, the product tokens are listed in order of their significance for identifying the application.\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0\nRFC 2616 Section 14.43\n\n\n\nReference IANA Site for full list of Headers\nResponse Header Fields\nRFC 2616 Section 6.2\nThe response-header fields allow the server to pass additional information about the response which cannot be placed in the Status-Line. \nResponse header fields give information about the server and about further access to the resource identified by the Request-URI.\n\nResponse-header field names can be extended reliably only in combination with a change in the protocol version. However, new or experimental header fields MAY be given the semantics of response-header fields if all parties in the communication recognize them to be response-header fields. Unrecognized header fields are treated as entity-header fields.\n\nList of Response Header Fields\n\n\n\nHeader Field Name\nDescription\nExample\nRFC Reference\n\n\n\n\nAccept-Ranges\nThe Accept-Ranges response-header field allows the server to indicate its acceptance of range requests for a resource\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nRFC 2616 Section 14.5\n\n\nAge\nThe Age response-header field conveys the sender's estimate of the amount of time since the response (or its revalidation) was generated at the origin server. A cached response is \"fresh\" if its age does not exceed its freshness lifetime. Age values are calculated as specified in RFC 2616 Section 13.2.3\nAge: 24\nRFC 2616 Section 14.6\n\n\nETag\nThe ETag response-header field provides the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant. The headers used with entity tags are described in sections 14.24, 14.26 and 14.44. The entity tag MAY be used for comparison with other entities from the same resource RFC 2616 Section 13.3.3\nETag: \"33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4\"\nRFC 2616 Section 14.19\n\n\nLocation\nThe Location response-header field is used to redirect the recipient to a location other than the Request-URI for completion of the request or identification of a new resource. For 201 (Created) responses, the Location is that of the new resource which was created by the request. For 3xx responses, the location SHOULD indicate the server's preferred URI for automatic redirection to the resource. The field value consists of a single absolute URI.\nLocation: /index.html\nRFC 2616 Section 14.30\n\n\nProxy-Authenticate\nThe Proxy-Authenticate response-header field MUST be included as part of a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) response. The field value consists of a challenge that indicates the authentication scheme and parameters applicable to the proxy for this Request-URI.\nProxy-Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==\nRFC 2616 Section 14.33\n\n\nRetry-After\nThe Retry-After response-header field can be used with a 503 (Service Unavailable) response to indicate how long the service is expected to be unavailable to the requesting client. This field MAY also be used with any 3xx (Redirection) response to indicate the minimum time the user-agent is asked wait before issuing the redirected request. The value of this field can be either an HTTP-date or an integer number of seconds (in decimal) after the time of the response.\nRetry-After: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT\nRFC 2616 Section 14.37\n\n\nServer\nThe Server response-header field contains information about the software used by the origin server to handle the request. The field can contain multiple product tokens RFC 2616 Section 3.8 and comments identifying the server and any significant subproducts. The product tokens are listed in order of their significance for identifying the application.\nServer: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)\nRFC 2616 Section 14.38\n\n\nVary\nThe Vary field value indicates the set of request-header fields that fully determines, while the response is fresh, whether a cache is permitted to use the response to reply to a subsequent request without revalidation. For uncacheable or stale responses, the Vary field value advises the user agent about the criteria that were used to select the representation. A Vary field value of \"*\" implies that a cache cannot determine from the request headers of a subsequent request whether this response is the appropriate representation.\nVary: User-Agent\nRFC 2616 Section 14.44\n\n\nWWW-Authenticate\nThe WWW-Authenticate response-header field MUST be included in 401 (Unauthorized) response messages. The field value consists of at least one challenge that indicates the authentication scheme(s) and parameters applicable to the Request-URI.\nWWW-Authenticate: Basic realm=\"Access to the staging site\", charset=\"UTF-8\"\nRFC 2616 Section 14.47\n\n\n\nReference IANA Site for full list of Headers\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← HTTP Status Codes\nHTTP Request and Response →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/request-response.html":{"url":"docs/request-response.html","title":"HTTP Request and Response","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - HTTP Request and Response\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nHTTP Request\nRFC 2616 Section 5\n\nA request message from a client to a server includes, within the first line of that message, the method to be applied to the resource, the identifier of the resource, and the protocol version in use.\n\nRequest Line\nRFC 2616 Section 5.1\n\nThe Request-Line begins with a method token, followed by the Request-URI and the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. The elements are separated by space characters. No Carriage Return (CR) or Line Feed (LF) is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence.\n\nHTTP Request Methods\nThe request line has 3 parts:\n\nThe HTTP Request Method\nGET\nPOST\nHEAD\nOPTIONS\nPUT\nDELETE\nTRACE\nCONNECT\n\n\n\nRequest Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\nRequest URI\n\nURIs have been known by many names: WWW addresses, Universal Document Identifiers, Universal Resource Identifiers [3], and finally the combination of Uniform Resource Locators (URL) and Names (URN). As far as HTTP is concerned, Uniform Resource Identifiers are simply formatted strings which identify-via name, location, or any other characteristic--a resource.\nThe Request-URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier and identifies the resource upon which to apply the request.\n\nUniform Resource Identifier\nThere are 4 options for a Request URI:\n\n* \n\nThe asterisk \"*\" means that the request does not apply to a particular resource, but to the server itself, and is only allowed when the method used does not necessarily apply to a resource\nExample: OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1\n\n\nAbsoluteURI\n\nThe absoluteURI form is REQUIRED when the request is being made to a proxy. The proxy is requested to forward the request or service it from a valid cache, and return the response. Note that the proxy MAY forward the request on to another proxy or directly to the server specified by the absoluteURI.\nExamples:\nhttps://example.org/absolute/URI/with/absolute/path/to/resource.txt\nhttps://example.org/absolute/URI/with/absolute/path/to/resource\nftp://example.org/resource.txt\nurn:ISSN:1535-3613\n\n\n\n\nAbsolutePath\n\nThe most common form of Request-URI is that used to identify a resource on an origin server or gateway. In this case the absolute path of the URI MUST be transmitted (see section 3.2.1, abs_path) as the Request-URI, and the network location of the URI (authority) MUST be transmitted in a Host header field.\nExample: https://example.org/absolute/URI/with/absolute/path/to/resource.txt\n\n\nAuthority\n\nAn authority part, comprising an optional authentication section of a user name and password, separated by a colon, followed by an at symbol (@) a \"host\", consisting of either a registered name (including but not limited to a hostname), or an IP address. IPv4 addresses must be in dot-decimal notation, and IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in brackets ([ ]). An optional port number, separated from the hostname by a colon\nExample: http://user:password@example.org:5071\n\n\n\nGeneral Header Fields\n\nThere are a few header fields which have general applicability for both request and response messages, but which do not apply to the entity being transferred. These header fields apply only to the message being transmitted.\n\n\n\n\nHeader Field Name\nDescription\nExample\nRFC Reference\n\n\n\n\nCache-Control\nThe Cache-Control general-header field is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request/response chain. The directives specify behavior intended to prevent caches from adversely interfering with the request or response. These directives typically override the default caching algorithms. Cache directives are unidirectional in that the presence of a directive in a request does not imply that the same directive is to be given in the response.\nCache-Control: no-cache\nRFC 2616 Section 14.9\n\n\nConnection\nThe Connection general-header field allows the sender to specify options that are desired for that particular connection and MUST NOT be communicated by proxies over further connections.\nConnection: keep-alive\nRFC 2616 Section 14.10\n\n\nDate\nThe Date general-header field represents the date and time at which the message was originated, having the same semantics as orig-date in RFC 822. The field value is an HTTP-date and MUST be sent in RFC 1123 Section 5 -date format.\nDate: Tue, 15 Nov 2015 08:12:31 GMT\nRFC 2616 Section 14.18\n\n\nPragma\nThe Pragma general-header field is used to include implementation-specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the request/response chain. All pragma directives specify optional behavior from the viewpoint of the protocol; however, some systems MAY require that behavior be consistent with the directives.\nPragma: no-cache\nRFC 2616 Section 14.32\n\n\nTrailer\nThe Trailer general field value indicates that the given set of header fields is present in the trailer of a message encoded with chunked transfer-coding.\nTrailer: header-names\nRFC 2616 Section 14.40\n\n\nTransfer-Encoding\nThe Transfer-Encoding general-header field indicates what (if any) type of transformation has been applied to the message body in order to safely transfer it between the sender and the recipient. This differs from the content-coding in that the transfer-coding is a property of the message, not of the entity.\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nRFC 2616 Section 14.41\n\n\nUpgrade\nThe Upgrade general-header allows the client to specify what additional communication protocols it supports and would like to use if the server finds it appropriate to switch protocols. The server MUST use the Upgrade header field within a 101 (Switching Protocols) response to indicate which protocol(s) are being switched.\nUpgrade: HTTP/2.0, SHTTP/1.3, IRC/6.9, RTA/x11\nRFC 2616 Section 14.42\n\n\nVia\nThe Via general-header field MUST be used by gateways and proxies to indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients between the user agent and the server on requests, and between the origin server and the client on responses. It is analogous to the \"Received\" field of RFC 822 and is intended to be used for tracking message forwards, avoiding request loops, and identifying the protocol capabilities of all senders along the request/response chain.\nVia: HTTP/1.1 GWA\nRFC 2616 Section 14.45\n\n\nWarning\nThe Warning general-header field is used to carry additional information about the status or transformation of a message which might not be reflected in the message. This information is typically used to warn about a possible lack of semantic transparency from caching operations or transformations applied to the entity body of the message.\nWarning: 110 anderson/1.3.37 \"Response is stale\"\nRFC 2616 Section 14.46\n\n\n\nRequest Header Fields\n\nThe request-header fields allow the client to pass additional information about the request, and about the client itself, to the server. These fields act as request modifiers, with semantics equivalent to the parameters on a programming language method invocation.\n\nPlease read over HTTP headers Section of this workshop\nEntity-Header Fields\n\nEntity-header fields define metainformation about the entity-body or, if no body is present, about the resource identified by the request. Some of this metainformation is OPTIONAL; some might be REQUIRED by portions of this specification.\n\n\n\n\nHeader Field Name\nDescription\nExample\nRFC Reference\n\n\n\n\nAllow\nThe Allow entity-header field lists the set of methods supported by the resource identified by the Request-URI. The purpose of this field is strictly to inform the recipient of valid methods associated with the resource. An Allow header field MUST be present in a 405 (Method Not Allowed) response\nAllow: GET, POST, HEAD\nRFC 2616 Section 14.7\n\n\nContent-Encoding\nThe Content-Encoding entity-header field is used as a modifier to the media-type. When present, its value indicates what additional content codings have been applied to the entity-body, and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied in order to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field. Content-Encoding is primarily used to allow a document to be compressed without losing the identity of its underlying media type.\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nRFC 2616 Section 14.11\n\n\nContent-Language\nThe Content-Language entity-header field describes the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed entity. Note that this might not be equivalent to all the languages used within the entity-body.\nContent-Language: en-US\nRFC 2616 Section 14.12\n\n\nContent-Length\nThe Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a GET.\nContent-Length: 3495\nRFC 2616 Section 14.13\n\n\nContent-Location\nThe Content-Location entity-header field MAY be used to supply the resource location for the entity enclosed in the message when that entity is accessible from a location separate from the requested resource's URI. A server SHOULD provide a Content-Location for the variant corresponding to the response entity; especially in the case where a resource has multiple entities associated with it, and those entities actually have separate locations by which they might be individually accessed, the server SHOULD provide a Content-Location for the particular variant which is returned.\nContent-Location: /documents/foo.txt\nRFC 2616 Section 14.14\n\n\nContent-MD5\nThe Content-MD5 entity-header field, as defined in RFC 1864, is an MD5 digest of the entity-body for the purpose of providing an end-to-end message integrity check (MIC) of the entity-body. (Note: a MIC is good for detecting accidental modification of the entity-body in transit, but is not proof against malicious attacks.)\nContent-MD5: md5-digest\nRFC 2616 Section 14.15\n\n\nContent-Range\nThe Content-Range entity-header is sent with a partial entity-body to specify where in the full entity-body the partial body should be applied. Range units are defined in RFC 2616 Section 3.12\nContent-Range: bytes 200-1000/67589\nRFC 2616 Section 14.16\n\n\nContent-Type\nThe Content-Type entity-header field indicates the media type of the entity-body sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the media type that would have been sent had the request been a GET.\nContent-Type: application/json\nRFC 2616 Section 14.17\n\n\nExpires\nThe Expires entity-header field gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale. A stale cache entry may not normally be returned by a cache (either a proxy cache or a user agent cache) unless it is first validated with the origin server (or with an intermediate cache that has a fresh copy of the entity).\nExpires: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT\nRFC 2616 Section 14.21\n\n\nLast-Modified\nThe Last-Modified entity-header field indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified.\nLast-Modified: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT\nRFC 2616 Section 14.29\n\n\n\nextension-header = message-header\n\nThe extension-header mechanism allows additional entity-header fields to be defined without changing the protocol, but these fields cannot be assumed to be recognizable by the recipient. Unrecognized header fields SHOULD be ignored by the recipient and MUST be forwarded by transparent proxies.\n\nMessage Body\n\nThe message-body (if any) of an HTTP message is used to carry the entity-body associated with the request or response. The message-body differs from the entity-body only when a transfer-coding has been applied, as indicated by the Transfer-Encoding header field.\n\n\nAll responses to the HEAD request method MUST NOT include a message-body, even though the presence of entity-header fields might lead one to believe they do. \n\nAll 1xx (informational), 204 (no content), and 304 (not modified) responses MUST NOT include a message-body. \n\nAll other responses do include a message-body, although it MAY be of zero length.\n\n\nExample Request Message Body\napplication/json format:\n{\n  \"admin\": true,\n  \"name\": \"Jean-Paul Belmont\"\n}\n\nHTTP Response\nAfter receiving and interpreting a request message, a server responds with an HTTP response message.\nStatus Line\nThe first line of a Response message is the Status-Line, consisting of the protocol version followed by a numeric status code and its associated textual phrase, with each element separated by space characters. No Carriage Return (CR) or Line Feed (LF) is allowed except in the final CRLF sequence.\nExample: 302 Found\nGeneral Header Information\nSee the section above General Header Fields\nResponse Header Fields\nSee the HTTP Header document part of the workshop and specifically read the Response Header Fields\nEntity-Header Fields\nPlease read the section above on Entity-Header Fields\nEntity Body\n\nThe entity-body (if any) sent with an HTTP request or response is in a format and encoding defined by the entity-header fields.\n\nentity-body    = *OCTET\n\nAn entity-body is only present in a message when a message-body is present. \n\nThe entity-body is obtained from the message-body by decoding any Transfer-Encoding that might have been applied to ensure safe and proper transfer of the message.\n\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← HTTP Headers\nURI Design →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/uri-design.html":{"url":"docs/uri-design.html","title":"URL Design","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - Uri Design\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nUniform Resource Identifiers (URI)\nRFC 2396\n\nA Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact string of characters for identifying an abstract or physical resource.\n\nOverview of URI\nUniform\nRFC 2396 Section 1.1\nUniformity provides several benefits:\n\nUniformity allows different types of resource identifiers to be used in the same context, even when the mechanisms used to access those resources may differ\n\nUniformity allows uniform semantic interpretation of common syntactic conventions across different types of resource identifiers;\n\nUniformity allows introduction of new types of resource identifiers without interfering with the way that existing identifiers are used\n\nUniformity allows the identifiers to be reused in many different contexts, thus permitting new applications or protocols to leverage a pre-existing, large, and widely-used set of resource identifiers.\n\n\nResource\nA resource can be anything that has identity.\n\nFamiliar examples include an electronic document, an image, a service (e.g., \"today's weather report for Los Angeles\"), and a collection of other resources.\n\nNot all resources are network \"retrievable\"; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound books in a library can also be considered resources.\n\nThe resource is the conceptual mapping to an entity or set of entities, not necessarily the entity which corresponds to that mapping at any particular instance in time.\n\nThus, a resource can remain constant even when its content---the entities to which it currently corresponds---changes over time, provided that the conceptual mapping is not changed in the process.\n\n\nIdentifier\n\nAn identifier is an object that can act as a reference to something that has identity.\n\nIn the case of URI, the object is a sequence of characters with a restricted syntax.\n\n\nExample URI\n\nftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1808.txt\n\nmailto:marcelbelmont@gmail.com\n\nnews:comp.infosystems.www.servers.unix\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/\n\n\nURI Characters and Escape Sequences\nRFC 2396 Section 2\n\nURI consist of a restricted set of characters, primarily chosen to aid transcribability and usability both in computer systems and in non-computer communications. Characters used conventionally as delimiters around URI were excluded.  The restricted set of characters consists of digits, letters, and a few graphic symbols were chosen from those common to most of the character encodings and input facilities available to Internet users.\n\nReserved Characters\nRFC 2396 Section 2.2\nMany URI include components consisting of or delimited by, certain special characters.\nThese characters are called \"reserved\", since their usage within the URI component is limited to their reserved purpose.\nIf the data for a URI component would conflict with the reserved purpose, then the conflicting data must be escaped before forming the URI.\nReserved characters:\n\n;\n/\n?\n:\n@\n&\n=\n+\n$\n,\n\nCharacters in the \"reserved\" set are not reserved in all contexts.\n\nThe set of characters actually reserved within any given URI component is defined by that component.\n\nIn general, a character is reserved if the semantics of the URI changes if the character is replaced with its escaped US-ASCII encoding.\n\n\nWhen a character from the reserved set (a \"reserved character\") has special meaning (a \"reserved purpose\") in a certain context, and a URI scheme says that it is necessary to use that character for some other purpose, then the character must be percent-encoded.\nPercent-encoding a reserved character involves converting the character to its corresponding byte value in ASCII and then representing that value as a pair of hexadecimal digits.\nUnreserved Characters\nRFC 2396 Section 2.3\nData characters that are allowed in a URI but do not have a reserved purpose are called unreserved.\nThese include upper and lower case letters, decimal digits, and a limited set of punctuation marks and symbols.\nUnreserved characters:\n\n-\n_\n.\n!\n~\n*\n'\n(\n)\n\nUnreserved characters can be escaped without changing the semantics of the URI, but this should not be done unless the URI is being used in a context that does not allow the unescaped character to appear.\nCharacters from the unreserved set never need to be percent-encoded.\nEscape Sequences\nRFC 2396 Section 2.4\n\nData must be escaped if it does not have a representation using an unreserved character\n\nthis includes data that does not correspond to a printable character of the US-ASCII coded character set, or that corresponds to any US-ASCII character that is disallowed, as explained below\n\n\nAn escaped octet is encoded as a character triplet, consisting of the percent character \"%\" followed by the two hexadecimal digits representing the octet code.\nFor example, \"%20\" is the escaped encoding for the US-ASCII space character.\nA URI is always in an \"escaped\" form, since escaping or unescaping a completed URI might change its semantics.\nNormally, the only time escape encodings can safely be made is when the URI is being created from its component parts\nEach component may have its own set of characters that are reserved, so only the mechanism responsible for generating or interpreting that component can determine whether or not escaping a character will change its semantics.\nLikewise, a URI must be separated into its components before the escaped characters within those components can be safely decoded.\nCommon Characters that are Percent Encoded\n\n\n\nCharacter\nPercent Encoding (PE)\nCharacter\nPE\nCharacter\nPE\nCharacter\nPE\n\n\n\n\nNewline\n%0A\n

absolute URI are written as follows:\n:\nThis \"generic URI\" syntax consists of a sequence of four main components:\n://?\nScheme names consist of a sequence of characters beginning with a lower case letter and followed by any combination of lower case letters, digits, plus (\"+\"), period (\".\"), or hyphen (\"-\").\nScheme ==> alpha *( alpha | digit | \"+\" | \"-\" | \".\" )\nAuthority Component\nRFC 2396 Section 3.2\nAn authority part, comprising:\n\nAn optional authentication section of a user name and password, separated by a colon, followed by an at symbol (@)\n\nA \"host\", consisting of either a registered name (including but not limited to a hostname), or an IP address.\n\nIPv4 addresses must be in dot-decimal notation, and IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in brackets ([ ]).\nAn optional port number, separated from the hostname by a colon\n\n\n\nSome URL schemes use the format \"user:password\" in the userinfo field.\nThis practice is NOT RECOMMENDED, because the passing of authentication information in clear text (such as URI) has proven to be a security risk in almost every case where it has been used.\nAuthority Component Example\nhttp://john:secret@rambo.net:3000/path/data\nThe part john:secret@rambo.net is the authority component\nPath Component\nRFC 2396 Section 3.3\nThe path component contains data, specific to the authority (or the scheme if there is no authority component), identifying the resource within the scope of that scheme and authority.\n\nThe path may consist of a sequence of path segments separated by a single slash \"/\" character.  Within a path segment, the characters \"/\", \";\", \"=\", and \"?\" are reserved.\n\nEach path segment may include a sequence of parameters, indicated by the semicolon \";\" character.\n\nThe parameters are not significant to the parsing of relative references.\n\n\nPath Component Example\nhttps://www.marcelbelmont.com/post/api-testing\nThe part /post/api-testing is the path component\nQuery Component\nRFC 2396 Section 3.4\nThe query component is a string of information to be interpreted by the resource.\nWithin a query component, the characters \";\", \"/\", \"?\", \":\", \"@\", \"&\", \"=\", \"+\", \",\", and \"$\" are reserved.\nQuery Component Example\nhttps://someuser.auth0.com/api/v2/authorize?audience=https://someuser.auth0.com/api/v2/&scope=openid%20profile%20 email&response_type=code&client_id=abcd13555&redirect_uri=https://task.io/callback\nThe part ?audience=https://someuser.auth0.com/api/v2/&scope=openid%20profile%20 email&response_type=code&client_id=abcd13555&redirect_uri=https://task.io/callback is the query component part.\nURI References\nRFC 2396 Section 4\n\nThe term \"URI-reference\" is used here to denote the common usage of a resource identifier.\n\nA URI reference may be absolute or relative, and may have additional information attached in the form of a fragment identifier.\n\nHowever, \"the URI\" that results from such a reference includes only the absolute URI after the fragment identifier (if any) is removed and after any relative URI is resolved to its absolute form.\n\n\nFragment Identifier\nRFC 2396 Section 4.1\nWhen a URI reference is used to perform a retrieval action on the identified resource, the optional fragment identifier, separated from the URI by a crosshatch (\"#\") character, consists of additional reference information to be interpreted by the user agent after the retrieval action has been successfully completed.\nAs such, it is not part of a URI, but is often used in conjunction with a URI.\nFragment Example\nhttps://github.com/jbelmont/api-workshop#workshop-details\nThe Fragment part is #workshop-details\nSame-document References\nRFC 2396 Section 4.2\nA URI reference that does not contain a URI is a reference to the current document.  In other words, an empty URI reference within a document is interpreted as a reference to the start of that document, and a reference containing only a fragment identifier is a reference to the identified fragment of that document.\nTraversal of such a reference should not result in an additional retrieval action.\nParsing a URI Reference\nRFC 2396 Section 4.3\nA URI reference is typically parsed according to the four main components and fragment identifier in order to determine what components are present and whether the reference is relative or absolute.\nThe individual components are then parsed for their subparts and, if not opaque, to verify their validity.\nRelative URI References\nRFC 2396 Section 5\n\nIt is often the case that a group or \"tree\" of documents has been constructed to serve a common purpose; the vast majority of URI in these documents point to resources within the tree rather than outside of it.  Similarly, documents located at a particular site are much more likely to refer to other resources at that site than to resources at remote sites.\n\nRelative addressing of URI allows document trees to be partially independent of their location and access scheme.\nFor instance, it is possible for a single set of hypertext documents to be simultaneously accessible and traversable via each of the \"file\", \"http\", and \"ftp\" schemes if the documents refer to each other using relative URI.\nEstablishing a Base URI\n\nThe term \"relative URI\" implies that there exists some absolute \"base URI\" against which the relative reference is applied.\n\nIndeed, the base URI is necessary to define the semantics of any relative URI reference; without it, a relative reference is meaningless.\n\nIn order for relative URI to be usable within a document, the base URI of that document must be known to the parser.\n\n\nPlease read sections: 5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.3, 5.1.4 for more details.\nResolving Relative References to Absolute Form\nThis section of RFC discusses an example algorithm for resolving URI references that might be relative to a given base URI.\nURI Normalization and Equivalence\nRFC 2396 Section 6\nIn many cases, different URI strings may actually identify the identical resource.\nFor example, the host names used in URL are actually case insensitive, and the URL http://www.XEROX.com is equivalent to http://www.xerox.com.\nIn general, the rules for equivalence and definition of a normal form, if any, are scheme dependent.\nWhen a scheme uses elements of the common syntax, it will also use the common syntax equivalence rules, namely that the scheme and hostname are case insensitive and a URL with an explicit \":port\", where the port is the default for the scheme, is equivalent to one where the port is elided.\nSecurity Considerations\nRFC 2396 Section 7\nA URI does not in itself pose a security threat.\nUsers should beware that there is no general guarantee that a URL, which at one time located a given resource, will continue to do so.\nNor is there any guarantee that a URL will not locate a different resource at some later point in time, due to the lack of any constraint on how a given authority apportions its namespace.\nSuch a guarantee can only be obtained from the person(s) controlling that namespace and the resource in question.\nA specific URI scheme may include additional semantics, such as name persistence, if those semantics are required of all naming authorities for that scheme.\nBread Crumb

that, along with data in the path component, serves to identify a resource within the scope of the URI's scheme and naming authority (if any).\nThe query component is indicated by the first question mark (\"?\") character and terminated by a number sign (\"#\") character or by the end of the URI.\nThe characters slash (\"/\") and question mark (\"?\") may represent data within the query component.\nQuery Component Example\nhttp://api.walmartlabs.com/v1/search?query=chromebook&format=json&apiKey=AKey12345\nThe query string here start after the ? character\nSo in this query you have the following pairs that are separated by the & delimiter:\n\nquery=chromebook\nformat=json\napiKey=AKey12345\n\nHTML Web Forms\nWeb Forms\nWhen a HTML Form is submitted the content of the form is encoded as follows:\nfield1=value1&field2=value2&field3=value3...\nThe query string is composed of a series of field-value pairs.\nWithin each pair, the field name and value are separated by an equals sign, '='.\nThe series of pairs is separated by the ampersand, '&' (or semicolon, ';' for URLs embedded in HTML and not generated by a ....\nResult filtering\nWhen doing a filtering action with a query string parameter than think about using a unique query parameter\nFor instance to get a particular student from a list:\nGET /students?id=5\n\nSorting\nA simple sorting example can be illustrated here:\nGET /users?sort=id\n\nHere we sort a list of users by ID\nIf we wanted to have a more advanced sorting feature we could perhaps do the following:\nGET /users?sort=-id,grade\n\nHere we have a comma separated list and use the - to denote descending sort order and additionally sort by grade\nSearching\nAt times you need more powerful constructs so you could use something like Elastic search or any other technology based on Apache Lucene that does full text search.\ncurl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_search?q=logged'\n\nNotice here that we use q=logged for our search query with Elastic Search.\nLimit payload information that resources return\nThe API consumer doesn't always need the full information returned from a particular resource.\nMobile clients can especially take advantage of this feature if you provide it.\nYou can use a fields query parameter which takes a comma separated list.\nGET /students?fields=id,name,grade\n\nThis query will only return the fields: id, name, and grade\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← URI Design\nAPI Design →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/api-design.html":{"url":"docs/api-design.html","title":"API Design","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - API Design\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nRestful URL\nUse nouns not verbs for your resources\nLet us make student resources\n\nGET /students - Retrieves a list of students\n\nGET /students/:id - Retrieves a specific student\n\nPOST /students - Creates a new student\n\nPUT /students/:id - Updates student #5\n\nPATCH /students/:id - Partially updates student #5\n\nDELETE /students/:id - Deletes student #5\n\n\nThe /students endpoint is for a collection\nThe /students/:id endpoint is for a specific element in the collection like for example /students/5\nDoing this will help you get HTTP verbs/actions out of your base URLs.\nWhy are verbs bad in URLs?\nLet us try to think about all the particular types of actions we can do with students:\n\n/getAllStudents\n/checkStudentGrades\n/retrieveStudent\n/updateStudents\n/updateSpecificStudent\n/deleteAllStudents\n/deleteSpecificStudent\n\nMapping urls to actions can quickly get out of hand and is not intuitive for app developers.\nKeep verbs out of your base URLs\nUse HTTP verbs to operate on the collections and elements.\nCRUD\nFor our student resources, we have two base URLs that use nouns as labels, and we can operate on them with HTTP verbs. \nOur HTTP verbs are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. \nWe can map them to the acronym CRUD: CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE\nResource Table\n\n\n\nResource\nPOST\nGET\nPUT\nPATCH\nDELETE\n\n\n\n\n/students\nCreate a New Student\nList all students\nBulk Update of all Students\nPartial Update\nDelete all Students\n\n\n/students/:id\nError\nShow Rocky Balboa\nIf Rocky exists then update him else Error\nDelete Rocky Balboa\n\n\n\nAs you can see With the two resources (/students and /students/:id) and the 5 HTTP verbs, we have a rich set of capabilities that is intuitive to use.\nTip:\n\nUse two base URLs per resource.\n\nKeep verbs out of your base URLs.  \n\nUse HTTP verbs to operate on the collections and elements.\n\n\nPlural and Concrete Names\nTry to favor plural names for a resource but above all else be consistent, don't use a plural name for one resource and then a singular name for another, this can quickly get confusing for an API consumer.\nFor example we used /students over /student for our student resources\nChoose concrete names over abstract names\nFor example what does an /items resource convey to you, not much right\nBut what does /toys resource convey to you\nThe level of abstraction can depend on scenarios but concrete names are more intuitive for API consumers.\nResource Associations\nResources tend to have relationships with other resources.\nLet us go back to our students resource.\nNow let us say that each student will have an associated teachers\nIf we wanted to get all the students belonging to a specific teacher we could do the following:\nGET /teachers/:id/students so for example an http request like this GET /teachers/754/students would get all students belonging to teacher number 754\nIf we wanted to add a new student to a particular teacher we could do the following:\nPOST /teachers/:id/students so for example an http request like this POST /teachers/754/student would create a new student under teacher number 754\nRelationships can get very complex however and it is not uncommon to see APIs nest 5 to 6 levels deep.\nOnce you have the primary key of a relationship then you shouldn't need to include relationship levels above the specific noun/object.\nMeaning there should not be many cases where you have to make particular URL  more than 3 levels deep /resource/identifier/resource.\nLimit complexity by using query strings\nMany APIs have many different states that a resource can be in.\nSimplify complexities by utilizing query string parameters.\nAny optional state that a particular resource can be in, can be conveyed by a particular query string.\nTo get all students living in dorms perhaps you could use the following query:\nGET /students?dorms=true\nKeep the API intuitive by using query strings where appropriate.\nError Handling\nTo most API consumers your API is a blackbox so having good error reporting in place provides proper context and visibility to an API.\nThe Extreme Programming Model teaches developers to learn to write through errors.\nSo for example if an API consumer uses a TDD approach when building their application then having good error reporting will help the app developers as they build their application.\nApp Developers also depend on well-designed errors when they are troubleshooting and when resolving issues as they are building their application with your API.\nTwilio Error Reporting\nLet us look at a twilio API error:\nWe will make the following restful call:\ncurl -X POST https://notify.twilio.com/v1/Services/ISXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/Notifications \\\n    -d 'Identity=0000005' \\\n    -d 'Title=Generic loooooooong title for all Bindings' \\\n    -d 'Body=This is the body for all Bindings' \\\n    -d 'Data={\"custom_key1\":\"custom value 1\",\"custom_key2\":\"custom value 2\"}' \\\n    -d 'Fcm={\"notification\":{\"title\":\"New alert\",\"body\":\"Hello Bob!\"}}' \\\n    -d 'Apn={\"aps\":{\"alert\":{\"title\":\"New alert\",\"body\":\"Hello Bob!\"}}}' \\\n    -u 'MyAuthToken12345:your_auth_token'\n\nHere we put an improper identity for the notifications API.\nWe get the following JSON response:\n{\n    \"code\": 20404,\n    \"message\": \"The requested resource /Services/ISXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/Notifications was not found\",\n    \"more_info\": \"https://www.twilio.com/docs/errors/20404\",\n    \"status\": 404\n}\n\nNotice here that you get an internal error code for twilio that maps to an application specific error code.\nYou get a detailed message explaining what occurred and you get a link to see how to fix the issue.\nThis is the kind of error response that is useful to an application developer where you give a descriptive message and provide a link to resolve the issue.\nTry to be verbose and use plain language descriptions in your error messages. \nAdd as many hints as you can possibly think of to the error itself to help the app developer figure out the problem.\nI recommend that you add a link in your description for more information, like Twilio provides. \nUsing HTTP Status Codes\nUse HTTP status codes and try to map status codes cleanly to relevant standard-based codes.\nThere are over 70 HTTP status codes and not every developer has all of the status codes memorized.\nTry to pick a decent subset of status code for your API.\nKeep in mind that Google GData API only uses 10 status codes. \nNetflix uses about 9 status codes.\n\n200, 201, 304, 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 410, 500\n\nEssentially you can reduce an interaction between an app and an API to 3 outcomes:\n\nEverything worked (success) 2xx-level http response code\nThe application did something incorrect (client error) 4xx-level http response code\nThe API did something incorrect (server error) 5xx-level http response code\n\nObviously this is completely true as there is need for 3xx-level (redirects) at times.\nThe main point I am trying to make is that start with a basic subset for your API and add more as you need them.\nAPI Versioning\nTry not to release an API without a version and make the version mandatory.\nAPI Providers use different techniques to version their APIs.\nA good approach to use is to specify the version with a 'v' prefix. \nMove the verions or v all the way to the left in the URL so that it has the highest scope (e.g. /v1/students).\nUse a simple ordinal number like v1 and avoid using the dot notation like v1.2 because it implies a level of granularity for versioning that doesn't work well with APIs. \nStick with v1, v2, v3, and so on\nAPI versions to maintain\nHow many API versions should you try to maintain? Try to maintain at least one version behind.\nYou want to give developers enough time to update their application code, but it all depends on the application developers' platform.\nSome might need 6 months while others might need a year.\nPuting API version information in the header\nAlthough putting api version information in the HTTP header is more aligned with Roy Fielding's vision of rest not a lot API Providers do this.\nHere is an example where using HTTP headers is cleaner:\nThese for example, all represent the same resource:\nGET students/1 \nContent-Type: application/json\n\nGET students/1 \nContent-Type: application/xml\n\nIn this example the header appears to be more correct and is still a very strong API design.\nYou will see some apis do the following though GET students/1.json and GET students/1.xml and that is fine as well.\nPartial Response\nWe discussed using the convention of a fields query string in Limit Payload section of the Query String Section\nThe field query parameters are also used in google and linkedin apis\nIt was actually google that pioneered the concept of a partial response, Read more about api performance tips at Google Developers Performance Site\nAs we stated earlier in the query string section you can use a comma delimited list to the fields parameter.\nHere is an example again with the students api:\nGET /students?fields=id,name,grade\n\nPagination\nStick to using the concept of a limit and offset as they are common with apis and developers are used what they mean\nSo let us go back to the students API.\nGET /students?limit=25&offset=50\n\nThis will get students 25 to 50\nA lot of APIs set a default limit of 10 and an offset of 10\nThe pagination defaults are dependent on your data size. \nIf your resources are large, you probably want to limit it to fewer than 10; if resources are small, then consider a larger limit.\nAPI Responses that do not involve resources\nThere are times that an api response will not involve an actual resource.\nFor instance a financial institution might have an endpoint that does some type of calculation and which never hits a database.\nAn action with a name like this indicates that you aren't dealing with a \"resource\" type of response:\n\nCalculate\nTranslate\nConvert\n\nIt is appropriate in this cases to use a verb instead of a noun.\nLet us go back to the students api example:\n/calculateFinalGrade?grades=90,83,99,85,91,92&weightedAvg=5\nThis endpoint although trivial is doing a calculation so the name calculateFinalGrade is appropriate in this instance.\nYou should make it clear in the API documentation that this is a non-resource scenario.\nIf you can separate endpoints like this into a separate part of your API so they get clearly delineated from resource type endpoints.\nRemember resources deal with nouns, while actions deal with verbs\nAccepting different types of responses\nIt is helpful to application developers can use multiple types of formats when working with a particular format.\nOn the other hand to make things uniform only return one format.\nGoogle Blogger API\nNotice here that the api uses a header of Content-Type: application/json\nSome other apis might do something like this: GET /events.json right in the url\nWe could do something similar in the students api like this:\nGET /students/12345/summary.json\nMost web apis will have a default format of JSON and it is okay to assume a default format as long as you highlight this in the API documentation.\nNaming Attributes\nLet us say you are returning metadata information back from a particular resource.\nFor instance if were to create new student in the students api:\nPOST /students we could return attributes like this createdAt, and updatedAt.\nSome APIs will name an attribute like this created_at and updated_at but try to avoid this.\nAn attribute name like created_at does not follow JavaScript notation.\nFor instance once you parse the response:\nlet student = JSON.parse(response);\n\nlet createdAt = student.created_at;\nNotice here that the created_at attribute breaks JavaScript convention.\nHere are some recommendations:\n\nPick JSON as default type\n\nFollow JavaScript conventions for naming attributes\n\ncamelCase (studentName) is best but depending on the attribute you could do Pascal Case (FinalGrade)\nHelps JavaScript developers work with names that go with typical JavaScript/JSON notation\n\n\n\nSearching\nLet us like how google does searching:\nI searched api workshops in Google with the following query: api workshop github\nThe query that google sent out looks like this:\nsearch?q=api+workshop+github&oq=api+workshop+github I removed some specific query parameters that google added\nNotice here Google uses search and uses the conventions of q=api+workshop+github to do the search.\nRemember that spaces are not allowed in query string so Google used the + instead\nIf we wanted to add scope to our search we could do the following in the students api\nGET /teachers/1234/students?q=math+science Here we do a search for all students that have math and science with teacher 1234\nIf we wanted to format the result we could do the following GET /search.xml?q=carolina+students which would return in xml format.\nAPI Domains\nPopular API Providers such as Facebook, and Twitter have multiple subdomains for their api is they have different apis.\nThis is understandable but you should strive to have one subdomain where your whole api lives.\nBy having one subdomain where your api lives you make it easier for other application developers to work with your API.\nConsolidate all APIs under one API subdomain if possible.\nA lot of popular API providers have one developer portal:\n\nGoogle Developer Portal\nFacebook Developer Portal\n\nIn our students example we can have a singular api subdomain as follows: api.students.com\nWe can have a developer portal as follows: developers.students.com\nYou can have developers get redirected to developer portal if they access api.students.com url in a browser\nClients that support limited HTTP Methods\nThere may exists some clients that cannot use all of the HTTP Methods.\nYou could do the following technique in this case:\nPOST /students?method=post\n\nGET /students\n\nPUT /students/1234?method=put&teacher=Parker\n\nDelete /students/1234?method=delete\n\nBe careful employing such a technique as you are using a GET Method that has destructive capability and a bot could inadvertently destroy your content. Such a tactic must be carefully thought about.\nAuthorization\n\nAuthentication is the process of verifying who you are. \n\nWhen you log on to a website with a user name and password you are authenticating.\n\n\nAuthorization is the process of verifying that you have access to particular resource. \n\nGaining access to a resource because the permissions configured on the resource allow you access is authorization.\n\n\n\nI would highly recommend that you choose OAuth 2.0 for Authorization needs.\nRFC 6749\n\nThe OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. \n\nUsing OAuth ensures that Web and Mobile Client that expose APIs will not have to share passwords.\nOAuth allows an API provider to revoke tokens for an individual user, for an entire app, without requiring the user to change their original password. \nThis functionality is critical if mobile devices are compromised or if a malicious application is on the loose.\nUsing Oauth will ensure improved application security and better end-user and consumer experiences for both Web and Mobile Clients.\nWe will also go over OAuth, Open ID, and Open ID Connect in greater detail later in the workshop.\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Query String\nAPI Testing →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/api-testing.html":{"url":"docs/api-testing.html","title":"API Testing","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - API Testing\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nWhat is API Testing?\nAPI Testing\n\nAPI testing is a type of software testing that involves testing application programming interfaces (APIs) directly and as part of integration testing to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security. Since APIs lack a GUI, API testing is performed at the message layer. API testing is now considered critical for automating testing because APIs now serve as the primary interface to application logic and because GUI tests are difficult to maintain with the short release cycles and frequent changes commonly used with Agile software development and DevOps\nAPI testing involves testing APIs directly (in isolation) and as part of the end-to-end transactions exercised during integration testing.\nAPI testing is used to determine whether APIs return the correct response (in the expected format) for a broad range of feasible requests, react properly to edge cases such as failures and unexpected/extreme inputs, deliver responses in an acceptable amount of time, and respond securely to potential security attacks. Service virtualization is used in conjunction with API testing to isolate the services under test as well as expand test environment access by simulating APIs/services that are not accessible for testing.\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← API Design\nTypes of API Testing →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/types-of-api-testing.html":{"url":"docs/types-of-api-testing.html","title":"Types of API Testing","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - Types of API Testing\nSections:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nTypes of API Testing\nTypes of API Testing\nAPI testing typically involves the following practices:\n\nUnit testing - Testing the functionality of individual operations.\n\nHere is an example of a unit test in golang:\npackage config_test\n\nimport (\n    \"os\"\n    \"testing\"\n\n    \"github.com/jbelmont/api-workshop/cmd/apid/config\"\n)\n\nfunc TestNewConfig(t *testing.T) {\n    cfg := config.New()\n\n    if cfg.APIHost != \":8080\" {\n        t.Error(\"config should set default value of APIHost variable\")\n    }\n    if cfg.MongoHost != \"mongodb://mongo:27017\" {\n        t.Error(\"config should set default value for MongoHost variable\")\n    }\n    if cfg.RedisHost != \"redis:6379\" {\n        t.Error(\"config should set default value for RedisHost variable\")\n    }\n}\n\nfunc TestGetEnvironmentVariablesThatAreSet(t *testing.T) {\n    apiHost := \":3000\"\n    os.Setenv(\"API_HOST\", apiHost)\n    defer os.Unsetenv(\"API_HOST\")\n\n    mongoHost := \"mongodb://mongo:30015\"\n    os.Setenv(\"MONGO_HOST\", mongoHost)\n    defer os.Unsetenv(\"MONGO_HOST\")\n\n    redisHost := \"redis:7005\"\n    os.Setenv(\"REDIS_HOST\", redisHost)\n    defer os.Unsetenv(\"REDIS_HOST\")\n\n    cfg := config.New()\n\n    if cfg.APIHost != apiHost {\n        t.Errorf(\"Expected %s but got %s\", apiHost, cfg.APIHost)\n    }\n    if cfg.MongoHost != mongoHost {\n        t.Errorf(\"Expected %s but got %s\", mongoHost, cfg.MongoHost)\n    }\n    if cfg.RedisHost != redisHost {\n        t.Errorf(\"Expected %s but got %s\", redisHost, cfg.RedisHost)\n    }\n}\n\n\nIntegration Testing - Testing (sometimes called integration and testing, abbreviated I&T) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing.\n\nHere is an example of an integration test in golang:\nfunc TestCreateHero(t *testing.T) {\n    heroPayload := `\n  {\n      \"name\": \"Aquaman\",\n      \"superpowers\": [\n        \"Expert with magical Trident\",\n        \"Enhanced vision\",\n        \"Enhanced smell\",\n        \"Enhanced stamina\",\n        \"Expert combatant\",\n        \"Expert tactician\",\n        \"Super Strength\",\n        \"Super Speed\",\n        \"Marine Telepathy\"\n      ],\n      \"gender\": \"male\"\n  }\n  `\n    payload := []byte(heroPayload)\n    r := httptest.NewRequest(\"POST\", \"/api/v1/heroes\", bytes.NewBuffer(payload))\n    w := httptest.NewRecorder()\n    app.ServeHTTP(w, r)\n\n    if w.Code != http.StatusCreated {\n        t.Fatalf(\"Should receive a status code of 201 for the response : %v\", w.Code)\n    }\n\n    var cHero hero.CreateHero\n    if err := json.NewDecoder(w.Body).Decode(&cHero); err != nil {\n        t.Fatalf(\"could not decode json response: %v\", err)\n    }\n\n    expected := hero.Hero{\n        Name: \"Aquaman\",\n        SuperPowers: []string{\n            \"Expert with magical Trident\",\n            \"Enhanced vision\",\n            \"Enhanced smell\",\n            \"Enhanced stamina\",\n            \"Expert combatant\",\n            \"Expert tactician\",\n            \"Super Strength\",\n            \"Super Speed\",\n            \"Marine Telepathy\",\n        },\n        Gender: \"male\",\n    }\n    if cHero.Name != expected.Name {\n        t.Errorf(\"Name should be set to %s\", expected.Name)\n    }\n    for idx, power := range cHero.SuperPowers {\n        if power != expected.SuperPowers[idx] {\n            t.Errorf(\"Expected Power %s, Actual %s\", expected.SuperPowers[idx], power)\n        }\n    }\n    if cHero.Gender != expected.Gender {\n        t.Errorf(\"Expected Gender %s, Actual %s\", expected.Gender, cHero.Gender)\n    }\n}\n\n\nFunctional testing - Testing the functionality of broader scenarios, often using unit tests as building blocks for end-to-end tests. Includes test case definition, execution, validation, and regression testing.\n\nLoad testing - Validating functionality and performance under load, often by reusing functional test cases.\n\nRuntime error detection - Monitoring an application the execution of automated or manual tests to expose problems such as race conditions, exceptions, and resource leaks.\n\nSecurity testing - Includes penetration testing and fuzz testing as well as validating authentication, encryption, and access control.\n\nWeb UI testing - Performed as part of end-to-end integration tests that also cover APIs, enables teams to validate GUI items in the context of the larger transaction.\n\n\nHere is an example of an end to end ui test with nightwatch.js\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  'Code

Navigation\n\nRestful API Testing\nAPI testing is a necessary task to do while building APIs.\nInstead of using a browser or typing into a UI and clicking buttons, you can test APIs using tools such as Curl and Postman.\nUsing a Rest Client you can make Rest calls such as for HTTP Verbs such as:\n\nGET\nPOST\nPUT\nDELETE\nPATCH\n\nWhen we test an API, we deal with JSON, XML, and Web Services.\n3rd Party APIs\nHere is a list of 3rd Party APIs:\n\nGoogle APIs\nYahoo APIs\nFacebook APIs\nStripe APIs\nAmazon APIs\nWalmart APIs\nGithub APIs\n\nGo to Programmable Web to get a complete list of 3rd Party APIs you can utilize\nTesting Restful APIs\nYou can utilize many different types of tools to test APIs such as:\n\nCurl\nPostman\nHTTPie\nInsomnia\nTelnet\n\nThere are other Rest Clients you can use I just listed a few here\nPostman Rest Client Advantages\nI tend to favor Rest Clients like Postman because it helps to automate testing Restful APIs if you utilize some of its advanced features\n\nNotice here that you can create collection folders that can categorize APIs.\nYou can do much more than this however\n\nNotice here that Basic {{encodeCredentials}} has curly braces around encodeCredentials\nIn Postman you surround variables in double curly braces\n\nIf you want to set variables before the HTTP call goes out than using Pre-request Script is what you want\n\nPre-request scripts are snippets of code associated with a collection request that are executed before the request is sent.\n\nThis is perfect for use-cases like including the timestamp in the request headers or sending a random alphanumeric string in the URL parameters.\n\nPre-request scripts are written in JavaScript, and the syntax is exactly like that of test scripts except that the response object is not present.\n\n\nNotice here that I am using common js syntax in Postman and in particular require('btoa')` which is using Postman Sandbox API\nYou can find a more complete list in the Postman Sandbox API reference\nYou can also read Postman Sandbox for other libraries available in Postman Rest Client\n\nNotice here that the Test script section is similar to Pre-Request Script\nWith Postman you can write and run tests for each request using the JavaScript language.\nBut more than that you can set variables in the Test script section that you can save for later use\nNotice here the use of postman.setEnvironmentVariable(\"access_token\", token_type + \" \" + access_token); to set access_token\nThis is really useful because we can save the access_token for other Rest calls\nInstead of manually setting the access token in a variable each day since access tokens tend to expire quickly you can use the tests script section to do that in an automated way.\nNotice that we also wrote a test in the test script section as well\n// Parse JSON response\nvar responseBody = JSON.parse(responseBody);\n\nvar access_token = responseBody.access_token;\nvar token_type = responseBody.token_type;\n\npostman.setEnvironmentVariable(\"access_token\", token_type + \" \" + access_token);\n\npm.test(\"Token Type is Bearer\", function () {\n    var jsonData = pm.response.json();\n    pm.expect(jsonData.token_type).to.eql(\"Bearer\");\n});\n\n\nNotice here we get a passing test since we got an access token from the Paypal API\n\nNotice here that we set the environment for Paypal here\nHere we can use global variables that can be used per environment\n\nHere I greyed out the environment variables for security reasons but you can read more about Global Variables at Postman Docs\n\nAnother useful feature in Postman is the Presets for Headers which you can read in the Docs\nHeader Presets are useful if you find yourself reusing a lot of HTTP Header values often and you can simply set a preset to autofill the HTTP headers for you in one click.\n\nNotice here that we can use the group edit feature to quickly set header values in key value pairs in the group edit view.\nYou can easily go back to the normal view by clicking Key-Value Edit button again.\n\nPostman supports all of the HTTP Verbs in their dropdown menu\n\nYou can easily set query string parameters utilizing the params section in postman\n\nNotice here that we can utilize developer tools in Postman.\nThis is useful when you want to debug the Pre-request Script and Test script sections in Postman\nYou can easily set console.log statements to debug things.\n\nNotice here that we can run all of the collections utilizing the collection runner.\nYou can read more about the Postman Collection Runner Here\nYou can import Postman collections easily and if you have Postman Pro account you can share collections with team members.\nI covered a good amount of features that Postman offers but read the Fine docs in Postman for more information.\nUsing Curl as a Rest Client\nCurl is also a powerful tool to test apis\nHere is a sample GET request using curl:\ncurl -X GET \\\n  'http://{{URL}}/search?query=chromebook&format=json&apiKey={{API_key}}' \\\n  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/xml'\n\nNotice here that we specified the HTTP verb using the flag -X we then gave a url and we specified HTTP Headers using -H\nHere is a sample POST request using curl:\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/payments/payment \\\n  -H 'Authorization: afaketoken1234567' \\\n  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n  \"intent\": \"sale\",\n  \"payer\": {\n  \"payment_method\": \"paypal\"\n

\"return_url\": \"https://www.example.com/return\",\n  \"cancel_url\": \"https://www.example.com/cancel\"\n  }\n}'\n\nNotice in the POST request we used -d flag to pass in a body to the request.\nUsing HTTPie as a rest client\nHere is an example POST request using HTTPie Rest Client\nhttp --form POST https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/oauth2/token \\\n'Authorization: Basic aFakeToken' \\\n'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\ngrant_type='client_credentials'\n\nUsing jq library for nice json output\nHere is an example using jq library\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v1/oauth2/token \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Basic afakeToken12345' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n  -d grant_type=client_credentials |

we will go over in this section:\n\nAuthentication\nAuthorization\nFederation\nDelegation\n\nAuthentication\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nAuthentication is the act of confirming the truth of an attribute of a single piece of data claimed true by an entity. In contrast with identification, which refers to the act of stating or otherwise indicating a claim purportedly attesting to a person or thing's identity, authentication is the process of actually confirming that identity. It might involve confirming the identity of a person by validating their identity documents, verifying the authenticity of a website with a digital certificate, determining the age of an artifact by carbon dating, or ensuring that a product is what its packaging and labeling claim to be. In other words, authentication often involves verifying the validity of at least one form of identification.\n\nAuthentication is the process of verifying who you are.\nWhen you log on to a PC with a user name and password you are authenticating.\nAuthentication is about who somebody is.\nAuthorization\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nAuthorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources related to information security and computer security in general and to access control in particular. More formally, \"to authorize\" is to define an access policy. For example, human resources staff are normally authorized to access employee records and this policy is usually formalized as access control rules in a computer system. During operation, the system uses the access control rules to decide whether access requests from (authentication) shall be approved (granted) or disapproved (rejected) [2]. Resources include individual files or an item's data, computer programs, computer devices and functionality provided by computer applications. Examples of consumers are computer users, computer Software and other Hardware on the computer.\n\nAuthorization is the process of verifying that you have access to something.\nGaining access to a resource because the permissions configured on it allow you access is authorization.\nAuthorisation is about what someone is allowed to do.\nFederation\nAccording to Wikipedia\n\nA federated identity in information technology is the means of linking a person's electronic identity and attributes, stored across multiple distinct identity management systems.\nFederated identity is related to single sign-on (SSO), in which a user's single authentication ticket, or token, is trusted across multiple IT systems or even organizations. SSO is a subset of federated identity management, as it relates only to authentication and is understood on the level of technical interoperability and it would not be possible without some sort of federation.\n\nDelegation\nDelegation is another process by which access and rights can be given to authorized users while maintaining a relatively limited amount of access.

It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.\nOpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including Web-based, mobile, and JavaScript clients to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The specification suite is extensible, allowing participants to use optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session management, when it makes sense for them.\nSee http://openid.net/connect/faq/ for a set of answers to Frequently Asked Questions about OpenID Connect.\nDifference between OpenID Connect and OpenID\nOpenID Connect is officially supported standard while OpenID 2.0 has been deprecated.\nSecurity Stack Exchange Post\n\nOpenID 2.0 and OpenID Connect are very different standards with completely different parameters and response body formats. Both are built on top of OAuth 2.0 by putting additional values into otherwise valid OAuth 2.0 requests and responses, in order to provide identity information needed for authentication (whereas OAuth 2.0 only provides authorization, not authentication). OpenID Connect improved naming and structure of OpenID 2.0 fields and parameters in order to be easier to use.\n\nDescription of How OpenID Connect Protocol Works\nLet's use the example we mentioned earlier, signing into Auth0 using your Google account, for a high level overview on how the flow works:\nWhen you choose to sign in with your twitter account for linkedin let us say, twitter will send an authorization request to LinkedIn.\nLinkedIn will then authenticate your credentials or ask you to login if you are not already signed in and then ask for your authorization and will ask for example to read your email address and ask if you are okay with this action.\nOnce you have athenticated and authorized to sign in then LinkedIn will send an access token and if requested an ID Token and send this back to twitter.\nTwitter can then retrieve user information from the ID Token or use the Access Token to invoke a LinkedIn API.\nOpenID Connect Specification\nHere is the official OpenID Connect Specification\n\nOpenID Connect Playground\nAuth0 built a nice tool to learn more about how OpenID Connect works which you can look at Here\n\nYou can configure the debugger by clicking this cog:\n\nHere is what the configuration looks like:\n\nYou just need to click the start button:\n\nYou will then be redirected back to login into auth0 account:\n\nOnce you enter the proper credentials you will be redirected back debugger and provided an Authorization Code:\n\nYou will then exchange this code for a token:\n\nYou can then click next to verify the id_token which is a json web token jwt:\n\nYou can look at the parts of the jwt by using the jwt debugger:\n\nHere is the base 64 decoded json web token information:\n{\n \"email\": \"-\", // omit personal info\n \"name\": \"-\", // omit personal info\n \"picture\": \"-\", // omit personal info\n \"nickname\": \"-\", // omit personal info\n \"groups\": [],\n \"app_metadata\": {\n  \"authorization\": {\n   \"groups\": []\n  }\n },\n \"email_verified\": false,\n \"clientID\": \"-\", // omit\n \"updated_at\": \"2019-01-21T00:29:32.295Z\",\n \"user_id\": \"-\", // omit\n \"identities\": [\n  {\n   \"user_id\": \"-\", // omit personal info\n   \"provider\": \"auth0\",\n   \"connection\": \"Username-Password-Authentication\",\n   \"isSocial\": false\n  }\n ],\n \"created_at\": \"2019-01-21T00:29:31.834Z\",\n \"authorization\": {\n  \"groups\": []\n },\n \"iss\": \"https://samples.auth0.com/\",\n \"sub\": \"auth0|5c45126bcd6e2731d2997f12\",\n \"aud\": \"kbyuFDidLLm280LIwVFiazOqjO3ty8KH\",\n \"iat\": 1548030699,\n \"exp\": 1548066699\n}\n\nAuthorization Code Review Diagram\nHere is a diagram illustration the authorization code flow that occurred in the debugger:\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Authentication\nAuthorization →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/authorization.html":{"url":"docs/authorization.html","title":"Authorization","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - Authorization\nSections:\n\nBasic overview of Authorization\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nBasic overview of Authorization\nWikipedia\n\nAccess control in computer systems and networks rely on access policies. The access control process can be divided into the following phases: policy definition phase where access is authorized, and policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved. Authorization is the function of the policy definition phase which precedes the policy enforcement phase where access requests are approved or disapproved based on the previously defined authorizations.\nMost modern, multi-user operating systems include access control and thereby rely on authorization. Access control also uses authentication to verify the identity of consumers. When a consumer tries to access a resource, the access control process checks that the consumer has been authorized to use that resource. Authorization is the responsibility of an authority, such as a department manager, within the application domain, but is often delegated to a custodian such as a system administrator. Authorizations are expressed as access policies in some types of \"policy definition application\", e.g. in the form of an access control list or a capability, on the basis of the \"principle of least privilege\": consumers should only be authorized to access whatever they need to do their jobs. Older and single user operating systems often had weak or non-existent authentication and access control systems.\n\"Anonymous consumers\" or \"guests\", are consumers that have not been required to authenticate. They often have limited authorization. On a distributed system, it is often desirable to grant access without requiring a unique identity. Familiar examples of access tokens include keys and tickets: they grant access without proving identity.\nTrusted consumers are often authorized for unrestricted access to resources on a system, but must be authenticated so that the access control system can make the access approval decision. \"Partially trusted\" and guests will often have restricted authorization in order to protect resources against improper access and usage. The access policy in some operating systems, by default, grant all consumers full access to all resources. Others do the opposite, insisting that the administrator explicitly authorizes a consumer to use each resource.\nEven when access is controlled through a combination of authentication and access control lists, the problems of maintaining the authorization data is not trivial, and often represents as much administrative burden as managing authentication credentials. It is often necessary to change or remove a user's authorization: this is done by changing or deleting the corresponding access rules on the system. Using atomic authorization is an alternative to per-system authorization management, where a trusted third party securely distributes authorization information.\n\nGood information on RFC 2196 - Site Security Handbook\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← OpenID Connect\nOAuth →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/oauth.html":{"url":"docs/oauth.html","title":"OAuth","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - OAuth\nSections:\n\nOAuth Roles\nProtocol Flow\nAuthorization Grant Types\nAccess Tokens\nClient Registration\nClient Types\nProtocol Endpoints\nObtaining Authorization\nReading through RFC 6749\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nOAuth Roles\nOAuth Roles\nOAuth defines four roles:\n\nresource owner\n\nAn entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.\nWhen the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.\n\n\nresource server\n\nThe server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.\n\n\nclient\n\nAn application making protected resource requests on behalf of the\nresource owner and with its authorization.\nThe term \"client\" does not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g.,\nwhether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other\ndevices).\n\n\nauthorization server\n\nThe server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.\n\n\n\nProtocol Flow\nThis is not my Diagram but the diagram in RFC 6749\n\nProtocol Flows\nThe abstract OAuth 2.0 flow illustrated in Figure 1 describes the\n   interaction between the four roles and includes the following steps:\n(A)  The client requests authorization from the resource owner.  The\n    authorization request can be made directly to the resource owner\n    (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization\n    server as an intermediary.\n(B)  The client receives an authorization grant, which is a\n    credential representing the resource owner's authorization,\n    expressed using one of four grant types defined in this\n    specification or using an extension grant type.  The\n    authorization grant type depends on the method used by the\n    client to request authorization and the types supported by the\n    authorization server.\n(C)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the\n    authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.\n(D)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates\n    the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token.\n(E)  The client requests the protected resource from the resource\n    server and authenticates by presenting the access token.\n(F)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,\n    serves the request.\nAuthorization Grant Types\n\nAn authorization grant is a credential representing the resource owner's authorization (to access its protected resources) used by the client to obtain an access token.\n\nRFC 6749 defines 4 Protocol flows that are called grant types:\n\nAuthorization Code: The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an intermediary between the client and resource owner.\n\nInstead of requesting authorization directly from the resource owner, the client directs the resource owner to an authorization server (via its user-agent as defined in RFC2616), which in turn directs the resource owner back to the client with the authorization code.\nThis is also used by mobile apps, using the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) technique.\nAuthorization Code\n\n\nImplicit Grant: The implicit grant is a simplified authorization code flow optimized for clients implemented in a browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript.\n\nIn the implicit flow, instead of issuing the client an authorization code, the client is issued an access token directly (as the result of the resource owner authorization).\nThe grant typeis implicit, as no intermediate credentials (such as an authorization code) are issued (and later used to obtain an access token).\nImplicit Grant\n\n\nResource Owner Password Credentials: The resource owner password credentials (i.e., username and password) can be used directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access\ntoken.\n\nThe credentials should only be used when there is a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the client (e.g., the client is part of the device operating system or a highly privileged application), and when other authorization grant types are not available (such as an authorization code).\nEven though this grant type requires direct client access to the resource owner credentials, the resource owner credentials are used for a single request and are exchanged for an access token.\nThis grant type can eliminate the need for the client to store the resource owner credentials for future use, by exchanging the credentials with a long-lived access token or refresh token.\nResource Owner Password Credentials\n\n\nClient Credentials: The client credentials (or other forms of client authentication) can be used as an authorization grant when the authorization scope is limited to the protected resources under the control of the client, or to protected resources previously arranged with the authorization server.\n\nClient credentials are used as an authorization grant typically when the client is acting on its own behalf (the client is also the resource owner) or is requesting access to protected\nresources based on an authorization previously arranged with the authorization server.\nClient Credentials\n\n\n\nAccess Tokens\nAccess Tokens\n\nAccess tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.  An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client.  The string is usually opaque to the client.\nTokens represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server.\n\nRefresh Tokens\nRefresh Tokens\n\nRefresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens.\n\nRefresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires, or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource owner).\n\nIssuing a refresh token is optional at the discretion of the authorization server.  If the authorization server issues a refresh token, it is included when issuing an access token.\n\n\nClient Registration\nClient Registration\n\nBefore initiating the protocol, the client registers with the authorization server.\nThe means through which the client registers with the authorization server are beyond the scope of this specification but typically involve end-user interaction with an HTML registration form.\n\nClient Types\nClient Types\n\nOAuth defines two client types, based on their ability to authenticate securely with the authorization server (i.e., ability to maintain the confidentiality of their client credentials).\n\nconfidential: Clients capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g., client implemented on a secure server with restricted access to the client credentials), or capable of secure client authentication using other means.\n\npublic: Clients incapable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g., clients executing on the device used by the resource owner, such as an installed native application or a web browser-based application), and incapable of secure client authentication via any other means.\n\n\nProtocol Endpoints\nProtocol Endpoints\nThere are 3 Protocol Endpoints defined by the specification\nThe authorization process utilizes two authorization server endpoints (HTTP resources):\n\nAuthorization endpoint - used by the client to obtain authorization from the resource owner via user-agent redirection.\n\nToken endpoint - used by the client to exchange an authorization grant for an access token, typically with client authentication.\n\nRedirection endpoint - used by the authorization server to return responses containing authorization credentials to the client via the resource owner user-agent.\n\n\nAuthorization Endpoint\nAuthorization Endpoint\n\nThe authorization endpoint is used to interact with the resource owner and obtain an authorization grant.\nThe authorization server MUST first verify the identity of the resource owner. The way in which the authorization server authenticates the resource owner (e.g., username and password login, session cookies) is beyond the scope of this specification.\n\nThe authorization endpoint is used by the authorization code grant type and *implicit grant type flows.\nThe client informs the authorization server of the desired grant type using the response_type parameter.\n\nresponse_type\nThe value MUST be one of \"code\" for requesting an authorization code, \"token\" for requesting an access token (implicit grant).\n\n\n\nRead RFC 6749 Sections 3.1.2 to 3.1.2.5 for more information on the Authorization Endpoint\nSample request to AUTH0 authorize endpoint:\nGET https://random.auth0.com/authorize?\n  audience=API_IDENTIFIER&\n  scope=SCOPE&\n  response_type=code&\n  client_id=SomeClientId&\n  redirect_uri=undefined&\n  code_challenge=CODE_CHALLENGE&\n  code_challenge_method=S111\n\nSample Response:\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nLocation: undefined?code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE\n\nToken Endpoint\nToken Endpoint\n\nThe token endpoint is used by the client to obtain an access token by presenting its authorization grant or refresh token.\nThe token endpoint is used with every authorization grant except for the implicit grant type (since an access token is issued directly).\n\nSample curl request to AUTH0 token endpoint:\ncurl --request POST \\\n  --url 'https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/oauth/token' \\\n  --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n  --data '{\"grant_type\":\"authorization_code\",\"client_id\": \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\",\"client_secret\": \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\",\"code\": \"AUTHORIZATION_CODE\",\"redirect_uri\": \"https://YOUR_APP/callback\"'\n\nSample Response:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8\nCache-Control: no-store\nPragma: no-cache\n\n{\n  \"access_token\":\"2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA\",\n  \"token_type\":\"example\",\n  \"expires_in\":3600,\n  \"refresh_token\":\"tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA\",\n  \"example_parameter\":\"example_value\"\n}\n\nObtaining Authorization\nObtaining Authorization\n\nTo request an access token, the client obtains authorization from the resource owner.\n\nThe authorization is expressed in the form of an authorization grant, which the client uses to request the access token.\n\n\nRead RFC 6749 Sections 4.1.1 4.4.3 for more information on Authorization Code Grant, Implicit Grant, Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant, and the Client Credentials Grant\nIssuing an Access Token\nIssuing an Access Token\nIf the access token request is valid and authorized, the authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh token.\n*If the request failed client authentication or is invalid, the authorization server returns an error response.\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Authorization\nFederation →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/federation.html":{"url":"docs/federation.html","title":"Federation","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - Federation\nSections:\n\nOverview of Federation\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nOverview of Federation\nWikipedia\n\nIn information technology (IT), federated identity management (FIdM) amounts to having a common set of policies, practices and protocols in place to manage the identity and trust into IT users and devices across organizations.\nSingle sign-on (SSO) systems allow a single user authentication process across multiple IT systems or even organizations. SSO is a subset of federated identity management, as it relates only to authentication and technical interoperability.\nCentralized identity management solutions were created to help deal with user and data security where the user and the systems they accessed were within the same network – or at least the same \"domain of control\". Increasingly however, users are accessing external systems which are fundamentally outside their domain of control, and external users are accessing internal systems. The increasingly common separation of user from the systems requiring access is an inevitable by-product of the decentralization brought about by the integration of the Internet into every aspect of both personal and business life. Evolving identity management challenges, and especially the challenges associated with cross-company, cross-domain access, have given rise to a new approach to identity management, known now as \"federated identity management\".\nFIdM, or the \"federation\" of identity, describes the technologies, standards and use-cases which serve to enable the portability of identity information across otherwise autonomous security domains. The ultimate goal of identity federation is to enable users of one domain to securely access data or systems of another domain seamlessly, and without the need for completely redundant user administration. Identity federation comes in many flavors, including \"user-controlled\" or \"user-centric\" scenarios, as well as enterprise-controlled or business-to-business scenarios.\nFederation is enabled through the use of open industry standards and/or openly published specifications, such that multiple parties can achieve interoperability for common use-cases. Typical use-cases involve things such as cross-domain, web-based single sign-on, cross-domain user account provisioning, cross-domain entitlement management and cross-domain user attribute exchange.\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← oAuth\nDelegation →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/delegation.html":{"url":"docs/delegation.html","title":"Delegation","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - Delegation\nSections:\n\nTypes of Delegation\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nTypes of Delegation\nWikipedia)\n2 classes of delegation:\n\nDelegation at Authentication/Identity Level\nDelegation at Authorization/Access Control Level\n\nDelegation at Authentication/Identity Level\n\nIt is defined as follows: If an authentication mechanism provides an effective identity different from the validated identity of the user then it is called identity delegation at the authentication level, provided the owner of the effective identity has previously authorized the owner of the validated identity to use his identity.\nThe existing techniques of identity delegation using sudo or su commands of UNIX are very popular.[citation needed] To use the sudo command, a person first has to start his session with his own original identity. It requires the delegated account password or explicit authorizations granted by the system administrator. The user login delegation described in the patent of Mercredi and Frey is also an identity delegation.\n\nDelegation at Authorization/Access Control Level\n\nThe most common way of ensuring computer security is access control mechanisms provided by operating systems such as UNIX, Linux, Windows, Mac OS, etc.\nIf the delegation is for very specific rights, also known as fine-grained, such as with Role-based access control (RBAC) delegation, then there is always a risk of under-delegation, i.e., the delegator does not delegate all the necessary permissions to perform a delegated job. This may cause the denial of service, which is very undesirable in some environments, such as in safety critical systems or in health care. In RBAC-based delegation, one option to achieve delegation is by reassigning a set of permissions to the role of a delegatee; however, finding the relevant permissions for a particular job is not an easy task for large and complex systems. Moreover, by assigning these permissions to a delegatee role, all other users who are associated with that particular role get the delegated rights.\nIf the delegation is achieved by assigning the roles of a delegator to a delegatee then it would not only be a case of over-delegation but also the problem that the delegator has to figure out what roles, in the complex hierarchy of RBAC, are necessary to perform a particular job. These types of problems are not present in identity delegation mechanisms and normally the user interface is simpler.\n\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← Federation\nAPI Description Languages →\n\n\n\n"},"docs/api-description-languages.html":{"url":"docs/api-description-languages.html","title":"API Description Languages","keywords":"","body":"API Workshop - API Description Languages\nSections:\n\nOverview of API Description Languages\nWhat is an API Description Language\nList of API Description Languages\nRestful API Description Languages\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\nOverview of API Description Languages\nAPI description languages can be thought of as the power tools of the API designer.\nAPI Description Languages make it easy to describe APIs in a precise way by working as a domain specific language.\nAPI Designers use API Description Languages to better capture API Design decisions.\nAPI Description languages can be used to describe the behavior of an API and can be used to build an API with automated tool support such as what Swagger provides.\nWhat is an API Description Language\nAPI Description Languages are domain specific languages that are used for describing APIs.\nTraits of API Description Languages:\n\nHuman Readable\nMachine Readable\nEasy for API Developers and API Designers to read, write and understand\nPrecise\nExpressive\nWell defined syntax that helps process with automated tools\n\nList of API Description Languages\nOverview of API Description Languages\n\nAPI Description Languages are sometimes called interface description languages (IDLs).

A short description of the response. CommonMark syntax MAY be used for rich text representation.\n\n\nheaders\nMap[string, Header Object | Reference Object ]\nMaps a header name to its definition. RFC7230 states header names are case insensitive. If a response header is defined with the name \"Content-Type\", it SHALL be ignored.\n\n\ncontent\nMap[string, Media Type Object]\nA map containing descriptions of potential response payloads. The key is a media type or media type range and the value describes it. For responses that match multiple keys, only the most specific key is applicable. e.g. text/plain overrides text/*\n\n\nlinks\nMap[string, Link Object | Reference Object]\nA map of operations links that can be followed from the response.

It's concise - you only write what you need to define - and reusable. It is machine readable API design that is actually human friendly.\n\n\nRoot\n\nEverything you enter in at the root (or top) of the spec applies to the rest of your API.\n\nThe baseURI you choose will be used with every Rest Call made\n\n\n#%RAML 1.0\n---\ntitle: Code Craftsmanship Saturdays API\nbaseUri: http://localhost:8080\nversion: v1\n\nResources\nIn RAML you define resources with the following syntax:\n/heroes:\n\n/heroes:\n  /{id}:\n\nThese resources go under the Root\nMethods\nYou can use the following HTTP Verbs with RAML:\n\nGET\nPATCH\nPUT\nPOST\nDELETE\nOPTIONS\nHEAD\n\nEach HTTP method can only be used once per resource.\nNest the methods to allow developers to perform these actions under your resources.\nNote that you must use lower-case for methods in your RAML API definition:\n/heroes:\n  get:\n  post:\n  /{id}:\n    put:\n    delete:\n    get:\n\nURI Parameters\nThe resources that we defined are collections of smaller, relevant objects.\nThis is a URI parameter, denoted by surrounding curly brackets in RAML:\n/heroes:\n  /{id}:\n\nNow in order to make a request to this resource the uri would look like this:\nhttp://localhost:8080/api/v1/heroes/5c3a241e092bd900c4444c88\nQuery Parameters\nAPI Consumers are also able to perform actions like filtering a collection and Query parameters allow you to accomplish filtering a collection.\n/heroes:\n  get:\n    queryParameters:\n      name:\n      superpowers:\n      gender:\n  post:\n\n\nQuery parameters may also be something that the server requires to process the API consumer's request, like an access token. Often, you need security authorization to alter a collection or record.\n\n/heroes:\n  get:\n    queryParameters:\n      name:\n      superpowers:\n      gender:\n    put:\n      queryParameters:\n        access_token:\n\n\nAn API's resources and methods often have a number of associated query parameters. Each query parameter may have any number of optional attributes to further define it.\n\nWe can specify attributes for each of the query string parameters like this:\n/heroes:\n  /{id}\n    get:\n      queryParameters:\n        name:\n          displayName: Name\n          type: string\n          description: A heroes name\n          example: Superman Prime\n          required: true\n

fulfill for each attribute.\nThe represented object has:\n\n\"name\" property of type \"string\", and is required\n\"superpowers\" property of type \"array\", and is required\netc\n\nExtract Schemas\n\nOne interesting RAML feature is the ability to extract the schemas and reference them by name.\n\nThere are three major advantages of extracting schemas and referencing the schemas by name:\n\nImprove RAML readability\nAllow reusing the schemas in several sections\ncontent\n\ntypes:\n  hero: {\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema\",\n    \"id\": \"http://jsonschema.net\",\n    \"required\": true,\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"name\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"required\": true\n      },\n      \"superpowers\": {\n        \"type\": \"array\",\n        \"required\": true\n      },\n      \"gender\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"required\": true\n      },\n      \"created\": {\n        \"format\": \"date-time\",\n        \"formatMinimum\": \"2013-11-17T00:00Z\",\n        \"formatMaximum\": \"2015-11-17T00:00Z\"\n      },\n      \"lastModified\": {\n        \"format\": \"date-time\",\n        \"formatMinimum\": \"2013-11-17T00:00Z\",\n        \"formatMaximum\": \"2015-11-17T00:00Z\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\nbody:\n  application/json:\n    type: hero\n    example: |\n      {\n        \"id\": \"5c42575e77802e00bf9ed411\",\n        \"name\": \"Aquaman\",\n        \"superpowers\": [\n            \"telepathic abilities\",\n            \"super strength\",\n            \"Intense heat resistance\",\n            \"Superhuman Hearing and Sonar\"\n        ],\n        \"gender\": \"male\",\n        \"created\":

allows you to be able to declare different types of resources which are called:\nResource Types in RAML\nresourceTypes:\n  collection:\n    get:\n    post:\n  collection-item:\n    get:\n    delete:\n    update:\n\nDefining and parameterizing resourceTypes\n\nDescription\nGET method with:\ndescription\nresponse for HTTP status 200 (which body's content type is \"application/json\")\n\n\nPOST method

\"application/json\")\n\n\n\nNow with this stated above let us define some resource types.\nresourceTypes:\n  collection:\n    description: Collection of Heroes\n    get:\n      description: Get a

automatically specified by its context.\nFor the resourceTypes case, there are two Reserved Parameters: resourcePath and resourcePathName.\nFor the /heroes example, the values will be \"/heroes\" and \"hero\" respectively.\nresourceTypes:\n  collection:\n    description: Collection of available > in Heroes\n    get:\n      description: Get a list of > based on the hero.\n      responses:\n

GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.\n\nGraphQL Schema Language\nA GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing functions for each field on each type. For example, a GraphQL service that tells us who the the hero is and his powers might look something like this:\nSchema Example\ntype Hero {\n  id: ID!\n  name: String\n  powers: [String]\n}\n\nGraphQL allows us to define and describe our data structures. For this purpose, GraphQL provides a typed schema language . We specify custom types for the data served by the API. A GraphQL schema is created by defining types, which have a number of fields, and by providing access functions for each field and each type.\n2 Different Languages in GraphQL\n\nThere is a query language and a schema definition language in GraphQL.\n\nThese two languages have different purposes.\n\nThe purpose of the schema definition language is to define the structure of the business data exposed by the GraphQL API. API providers use the schema definition language to specify the interface.\n\nThe purpose of the query language is to interact with the GraphQL endpoint.\n\nClients use the query language for reading data, writing data or subscribing to notifications.\n\nThe schema serves as a constraint on the possible interactions.\n\n\nWhy is GraphQL have the Graph Part?\nA graph is a very generic data structure and it should be possible to express the data of any application in the form of a graph, and so this graph which is formed by all application data, is what we call the graph in GraphQL.\nFields\n\nAt its simplest, GraphQL is about asking for specific fields on objects. Let's start by looking at a very simple query and the result we get when we run it:\n\nGraphQL query:\n{\n  hero {\n    name\n    powers\n    gender\n  }\n}\n\ncould return the following json payload:\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"hero\": {\n      \"name\": \"Superman\",\n      \"powers\": [\n        \"Superhuman Speed\",\n        \"Superhuman Strength\",\n        \"Superhuman Stamina\",\n        \"Superhuman Durability\",\n        \"Regenerative Healing Factor\",\n        \"Immunity to All Diseases and Viruses\"\n      ],\n      \"gender\": \"male\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nArguments\nIn GraphQL you have the ability to pass in argument into fields.\n\nIn a system like REST, you can only pass a single set of arguments - the query parameters and URL segments in your request. But in GraphQL, every field and nested object can get its own set of arguments, making GraphQL a complete replacement for making multiple API fetches. You can even pass arguments into scalar fields, to implement data transformations once on the server, instead of on every client separately.\n\n{\n  hero(id: \"2\") {\n    name\n    powers\n    gender\n  }\n}\n\nwould return the hero with an id of 2 which in this case would return this payload:\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"hero\": {\n      \"name\": \"Immortal Hulk\",\n      \"superpowers\": [\n          \"Superhuman Speed\",\n          \"Superhuman Strength\",\n          \"Transformation\",\n          \"Self Sustenance\",\n          \"Superhuman Stamina\",\n          \"Superhuman Durability\",\n          \"Regenerative Healing Factor\",\n          \"Resistance to Psychic Control\",\n          \"Immunity to All Diseases and Viruses\",\n          \"Superhuman Leaping Ability\",\n          \"Astral Form Perception\",\n          \"Homing Ability\",\n          \"Gamma Radiation/Energy Manipulation and Emission\",\n          \"Adaptation to Hostile Environments\",\n          \"Immortality\"\n      ],\n      \"gender\": \"male\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nAliases\nAliases in GraphQL let you rename the result of a field:\n{\n  dcHero: hero(world: DC) {\n    name\n    powers\n    gender\n  }\n  marvelHero: hero(world: MARVEL) {\n    name\n    powers\n    gender\n  }\n}\n\nso here we could get the following json payload with the following renamed fields:\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"dcHero\": {\n      \"name\": \"Superman\",\n      \"powers\": [\n        \"Superhuman Speed\",\n        \"Superhuman Strength\",\n        \"Superhuman Stamina\",\n        \"Superhuman Durability\",\n        \"Regenerative Healing Factor\",\n        \"Immunity to All Diseases and Viruses\"\n      ],\n      \"gender\": \"male\"\n    },\n    \"marvelHero\": {\n      \"name\": \"Immortal Hulk\",\n      \"powers\": [\n        \"Superhuman Speed\",\n          \"Superhuman Strength\",\n          \"Transformation\",\n          \"Self Sustenance\",\n          \"Superhuman Stamina\",\n          \"Superhuman Durability\",\n          \"Regenerative Healing Factor\",\n          \"Resistance to Psychic Control\",\n          \"Immunity to All Diseases and Viruses\",\n          \"Superhuman Leaping Ability\",\n          \"Astral Form Perception\",\n          \"Homing Ability\",\n          \"Gamma Radiation/Energy Manipulation and Emission\",\n          \"Adaptation to Hostile Environments\",\n          \"Immortality\"\n      ],\n      \"gender\": \"male\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nFragments\nIn GraphQL fragments let you solve issues with duplication and grant code reuse.\n{\n  dcHero: hero(world: DC) {\n    ...heroFields\n  }\n  marvelHero: hero(world: MARVEL) {\n    ...heroFields\n  }\n}\n\nfragment heroFields on Hero {\n  name\n  powers\n  gender\n}\n\nVariables in Fragments\nIt is possible for fragments to use variables declared in query or mutation.\nquery HeroComparison($first: Int = 3) {\n  dcHero: hero(world: DC) {\n    ...heroFields\n  }\n  marvelHero: hero(world: MARVEL) {\n    ...heroFields\n  }\n}\nfragment heroFields on Hero {\n  name\n  powers\n  gender\n  friendsConnection(first: $first) {\n    totalCount\n    edges {\n      node {\n        name\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNotice here how we reused the $first variable from the query\nOperation Name\nWe have been using the graphql shorthand syntax but it is better in production to use an operation name.\n\nThe operation type is either query, mutation, or subscription and describes what type of operation you're intending to do. The operation type is required unless you're using the query shorthand syntax, in which case you can't supply a name or variable definitions for your operation.\nThe operation name is a meaningful and explicit name for your operation. It is only required in multi-operation documents, but its use is encouraged because it is very helpful for debugging and server-side logging. When something goes wrong either in your network logs or your GraphQL server, it is easier to identify a query in your codebase by name instead of trying to decipher the contents. Think of this just like a function name in your favorite programming language. For example, in JavaScript we can easily work only with anonymous functions, but when we give a function a name, it's easier to track it down, debug our code, and log when it's called. In the same way, GraphQL query and mutation names, along with fragment names, can be a useful debugging tool on the server side to identify different GraphQL requests.\n\nHere is an example of a graphql query operation:\nquery HeroNameAndFriends {\n  hero {\n    name\n    powers\n    gender\n    friends {\n      name\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nwhich would return the following json payload:\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"hero\": {\n      \"name\": \"Superman\",\n      \"powers\": [\n        \"Superhuman Speed\",\n        \"Superhuman Strength\",\n        \"Superhuman Stamina\",\n        \"Superhuman Durability\",\n        \"Regenerative Healing Factor\",\n        \"Immunity to All Diseases and Viruses\"\n      ],\n      \"gender\": \"male\",\n      \"friends\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Batman\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Han Solo\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nVariables\nWe need to 3 things to work with variables:\n\nReplace the static value in the query with $variableName\n\nDeclare $variableName as one of the variables accepted by the query\n\nPass variableName: value in the separate, transport-specific (usually JSON) variables dictionary\n\n\nHere is an example:\nquery HeroNameAndFriends($organization: ComicOrganization) {\n  hero(organization: $organization) {\n    name\n    friends {\n      name\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Pass in value for $organization\n{\n  \"organization\": \"DC\"\n}\n\nHere is the corresponding response payload:\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"hero\": {\n      \"name\": \"Superman\",\n      \"friends\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Batman\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Wonder Woman\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nDefault Variables\nDefault values can also be assigned to the variables in the query by adding the default value after the type declaration.\nquery HeroNameAndFriends($organization: ComicOrganization = DC) {\n  hero(organization: $organization) {\n    name\n    friends {\n      name\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNotice here that we passed in a default value of 'DC' for the $organization variable.\nDirectives\n\nA directive can be attached to a field or fragment inclusion, and can affect execution of the query in any way the server desires. The core GraphQL specification includes exactly two directives, which must be supported by any spec-compliant GraphQL server implementation.\n\nHere are the 2 directives:\n\n@include(if: Boolean) Only include this field in the result if the argument is true.\n\n@skip(if: Boolean) Skip this field if the argument is true.\n\n\nHere is the query:\nquery HeroNameAndFriends($organization: ComicOrganization = DC, $hasFriends: Boolean!) {\n  hero(organization: $organization) {\n    name\n    friends @include(if: $hasfriends) {\n      name\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHere is an example of passing in variables:\n{\n  \"organization\": \"Marvel\",\n  \"hasFriends\": false\n}\n\nHere would be a possible payload:\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"hero\": {\n      \"name\": \"Deadpool\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nMutations\nMutations in GraphQL are used to update/create date.\nRemember that in REST we would by convention use a GET Request to retrieve data.\nIn order to do a write operation in REST we can use a POST for creation, PUT for an update, and PATCH for a partial update.\nYou could in theory use a query to do a write operation but in GraphQL the most appropriate operation is a Mutation.\nLet us create a new Hero by using a mutation:\nmutation CreateHero($organization: ComicOrganization!, $name: NAME, $powers: Abilities, $gender: GENDER) {\n  createHero(organization: $organization, name: $name, powers: $powers, gender: $gender) {\n    organization\n    name\n    powers\n    gender\n  }\n}\n\nHere would be the variables passed in:\n{\n  \"organization\": \"DC\",\n  \"name\": \"Superman\",\n  \"powers\": [\n    \"Solar energy absorption\",\n    \"Superhuman Strength\",\n    \"Invulnerability\",\n    \"Superhuman speed\",\n    \"Flight\",\n    \"Healing-factor\",\n    \"Super-stamina, endurance, durability, agility and reflexes\",\n    \"Super-senses\",\n    \"Super-intelligence\",\n    \"Super-memory\",\n    \"Super-breath and Arctic breath\",\n    \"Multilingualism\",\n    \"Longevity\",\n    \"Solar-Flare (New 52)\",\n    \"Energy signals and transmissions awareness (New 52)\",\n  ],\n  \"gender\": \"male\"\n}\n\nInline Fragments\nIf you are querying a field that returns an interface or a union type, you will need to use inline fragments to access data on the underlying concrete type.\nHere is an example:\nquery HeroGroups($organization: Organization!) {\n  heroGroups(organization: $organization) {\n    name\n    ... on DC {\n      rating\n      members\n    }\n    ... on Marvel {\n      members\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nHere we pass the following json value for variable:\n{\n  \"organization\": \"DC\"\n}\n\nHere is one possible json payload:\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"hero\": {\n      \"rating\": 10,\n      \"members\": [\n        \"Aquaman\",\n        \"The Atom\",\n        \"Aztek\",\n        \"Batman\",\n        \"Black Canary\",\n        \"Booster Gold\",\n        \"Captain Marvel\",\n        \"Catwoman\",\n        \"Crimson Fox\",\n        \"Cyborg\",\n        \"Doctor Fate\",\n        \"The Elongated Man\",\n        \"Firestorm\",\n        \"The Flash\",\n        \"Green Arrow\",\n        \"Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)\",\n        \"Green Lantern (John Stewart)\",\n        \"Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner)\",\n        \"Green Lantern (Simon Baz)\",\n        \"Hawkgirl\",\n        \"Hawkman\",\n        \"Hawkwoman\",\n        \"Huntress\",\n        \"Killer Frost\",\n        \"Lobo\",\n        \"The Martian Manhunter\",\n        \"Mera\",\n        \"Metamorpho\",\n        \"Mister Miracle\",\n        \"Phantom Stranger\",\n        \"Plastic Man\",\n        \"The Ray\",\n        \"Red Tornado\",\n        \"Steel\",\n        \"Supergirl\",\n        \"Superman\",\n        \"Shazam\",\n        \"Vibe\",\n        \"Vixen\",\n        \"Wonder Woman\",\n        \"Zatanna\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNotice that we passed in DC for the organization which has a list of members and a rating of 1 to 10 whereas Marvel just has members.\nGraphQL Query Language\nWhat is a GraphQL Query?\nA GraphQL query consists of one ore more patterns and one method.\nThe patterns are matched against parts of the graph.\nThe method determines how the matched parts of the graph are processed.\nThe language provides methods for retrieving data, writing data and getting notified when the data changes.\nType System\nadd content here\nType Language\nadd content here\nObject Types and Fields\nadd content here\nArguments\nadd content here\nQuery and Mutation Types\nadd content here\nScalar Types\nadd content here\nEnumeration Types\nadd content here\nLists and Non-null\nadd content here\nInterfaces\nadd content here\nUnion Types\nadd content here\nInput Types\nadd content here\nGraphiQL\nFor the workshop we will use Github's GraphiQL Explorer:\n\nNotice in the screenshot below that we have a separate pane to put our variables for graphql:\n\nLink to Github V4 API\nBread Crumb Navigation\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\n\n\n\n← RAML\nREADME →\n\n\n\n"}}}
