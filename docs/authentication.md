#### Types of Authentication

The different types of authentication:

* Single-factor Authentication
* Two-factor Authentication
* Multi-factor Authentication

###### Single-factor authentication

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication#Single-factor_authentication)

Single-factor authentication is the weakest level of authentication.

Since there is only one factor of authentication there is an easier attact vector for malicious intrusion.

Single-factor authentication is not recommended for financial/personally transactions which typically warrant a higher level of security.

###### Two-factor authentication

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication#Two-factor_authentication)

> When elements representing two factors are required for authentication, the term two-factor authentication is applied—e.g. a bankcard (something the user has) and a PIN (something the user knows). Business networks may require users to provide a password (knowledge factor) and a pseudorandom number from a security token (ownership factor). Access to a very-high-security system might require a mantrap screening of height, weight, facial, and fingerprint checks (several inherence factor elements) plus a PIN and a day code (knowledge factor elements), but this is still a two-factor authentication.

###### Multi-factor authentication

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)

> Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a method of confirming a user's claimed identity in which a computer user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism: knowledge (something the user and only the user knows), possession (something the user and only the user has), and inherence (something the user and only the user is).
