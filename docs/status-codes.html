<h4 id="response-status-code">Response Status Code</h4>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6" target="_blank">Response Status Codes RFC 7231</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The status-code element is a three-digit integer code giving the result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>HTTP status codes are extensible.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>HTTP clients are not required to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such understanding is obviously desirable.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>However, a client MUST understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first digit, and treat an unrecognized status code as being equivalent to the x00 status code of that class, with the exception that a recipient MUST NOT cache a response with an unrecognized status code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if an unrecognized status code of 471 is received by a client, the client can assume that there was something wrong with its request and treat the response as if it had received a 400 (Bad Request) status code.  The response message will usually contain a representation that explains the status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first digit of the status-code defines the class of response.</p>
<p>The last two digits do not have any categorization role.  </p>
<p>There are five values for the first digit:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process</p>
</li>
<li><p>2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted</p>
</li>
<li><p>3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request</p>
</li>
<li><p>4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled</p>
</li>
<li><p>5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1xx-informational">1xx (Informational)</h4>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.2" target="_blank">1xx RFC 7231</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The 1xx (Informational) class of status code indicates an interim response for communicating connection status or request progress prior to completing the requested action and sending a final response. </p>
</li>
<li><p>1xx responses are terminated by the first empty line after the status-line (the empty line signaling the end of the header section).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status codes, a server MUST NOT send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A client MUST be able to parse one or more 1xx responses received prior to a final response, even if the client does not expect one. </p>
</li>
<li><p>A user agent MAY ignore unexpected 1xx responses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A proxy MUST forward 1xx responses unless the proxy itself requested the generation of the 1xx response.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>For example, if a proxy adds an &quot;Expect: 100-continue&quot; field when it forwards a request, then it need not forward the corresponding 100 (Continue) response(s).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="100-continue">100 Continue</h6>
<p>The server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body.</p>
<h6 id="101-switching-protocols">101 Switching protocols</h6>
<p>The requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server is acknowledging that it will do so.</p>
<h6 id="102-processing">102 Processing</h6>
<p>The server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.</p>
<h4 id="2xx-successful">2xx (Successful)</h4>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3" target="_blank">2xx RFC 7231</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2xx (Successful) class of status code indicates that the client&apos;s request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h6 id="200-ok">200 OK</h6>
<p>The standard response for successful HTTP requests.</p>
<h6 id="201-created">201 Created</h6>
<p>The request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created.</p>
<h6 id="202-accepted">202 Accepted</h6>
<p>The request has been accepted but has not been processed yet. This code does not guarantee that the request will process successfully.</p>
<h6 id="203-non-authoritative-information">203 Non-authoritative information</h6>
<p>HTTP 1.1. The server successfully processed the request but is returning information from another source.</p>
<h6 id="204-no-content">204 No content</h6>
<p>The server accepted the request but is not returning any content. This is often used as a response to a DELETE request.</p>
<h6 id="205-reset-content">205 Reset content</h6>
<p>Similar to a 204 No Content response but this response requires the requester to reset the document view.</p>
<h6 id="206-partial-content">206 Partial content</h6>
<p>The server is delivering only a portion of the content, as requested by the client via a range header.</p>
<h6 id="207-multi-status">207 Multi-status</h6>
<p>The message body that follows is an XML message and can contain a number of separate response codes, depending on how many sub-requests were made.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918" target="_blank">WebDAV - RFC 4918</a></p>
<h6 id="208-already-reported">208 Already reported</h6>
<p>The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a previous reply to this request, and are not being included again.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5842" target="_blank">WebDAV - RFC 5842</a></p>
<h6 id="226-im-used">226 IM used</h6>
<p>The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.</p>
<h4 id="3xx-redirection">3xx (Redirection)</h4>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4" target="_blank">3xx RFC 7231</a></p>
<p>The 3xx (Redirection) class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If a Location header field (Section 7.1.2) is provided, the user agent MAY automatically redirect its request to the URI referenced by the Location field value, even if the specific status code is not understood. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Automatic redirection needs to done with care for methods not known to be safe, as defined in Section 4.2.1, since the user might not wish to redirect an unsafe request.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several types of redirects:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Redirects that indicate the resource might be available at a different URI, as provided by the Location field, as in the status codes 301 (Moved Permanently), 302 (Found), and 307 (Temporary Redirect).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Redirection that offers a choice of matching resources, each capable of representing the original request target, as in the 300 (Multiple Choices) status code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Redirection to a different resource, identified by the Location field, that can represent an indirect response to the request, as in the 303 (See Other) status code.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Redirection to a previously cached result, as in the 304 (Not Modified) status code.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h6 id="300-multiple-choices">300 Multiple choices</h6>
<p>There are multiple options that the client may follow.</p>
<h6 id="301-moved-permanently">301 Moved permanently</h6>
<p>The resource has been moved and all further requests should reference its new URI.</p>
<h6 id="302-found">302 Found</h6>
<p>The HTTP 1.0 specification described this status as &quot;Moved Temporarily&quot;, but popular browsers respond to this status similar to behavior intended for 303. The resource can be retrieved by referencing the returned URI.</p>
<h6 id="303-see-other">303 See other</h6>
<p>The resource can be retrieved by following other URI using the GET method. When received in response to a POST, PUT, or DELETE, it can usually be assumed that the server processed the request successfully and is sending the client to an informational endpoint.</p>
<h6 id="304-not-modified">304 Not modified</h6>
<p>The resource has not been modified since the version specified in If-Modified-Since or If-Match headers. The resource will not be returned in response body.</p>
<h6 id="305-use-proxy">305 Use proxy</h6>
<p>HTTP 1.1. The resource is only available through a proxy and the address is provided in the response.</p>
<h6 id="306-switch-proxy">306 Switch proxy</h6>
<p>Deprecated in HTTP 1.1. Used to mean that subsequent requests should be sent using the specified proxy.</p>
<h6 id="307-temporary-redirect">307 Temporary redirect</h6>
<p>HTTP 1.1. The request should be repeated with the URI provided in the response, but future requests should still call the original URI.</p>
<h6 id="308-permanent-redirect">308 Permanent redirect</h6>
<p>Experimental. The request and all future requests should be repeated with the URI provided in the response. The HTTP method is not allowed to be changed in the subsequent request.</p>
<h6 id="308-resume-incomplete-google">308 Resume Incomplete (Google)</h6>
<p>This code is used in the Resumable HTTP Requests Proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests</p>
<h4 id="4xx-client-error">4xx (Client Error)</h4>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5" target="_blank">4xx RFC 7231</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The 4xx (Client Error) class of status code indicates that the client seems to have erred.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD send a representation containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. </p>
</li>
<li><p>These status codes are applicable to any request method. </p>
</li>
<li><p>User agents SHOULD display any included representation to the user.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Reserved for future use. Some web services use this as an indication that the client has sent an excessive number of requests.</p>
<h6 id="403-forbidden">403 Forbidden</h6>
<p>The request was formatted correctly but the server is refusing to supply the requested resource. Unlike 401, authenticating will not make a difference in the server&apos;s response.</p>
<h6 id="404-not-found">404 Not found</h6>
<p>The resource could not be found. This is often used as a catch-all for all invalid URIs requested of the server.</p>
<h6 id="405-method-not-allowed">405 Method not allowed</h6>
<p>The resource was requested using a method that is not allowed. For example, requesting a resource via a POST method when the resource only supports the GET method.</p>
<h6 id="406-not-acceptable">406 Not acceptable</h6>
<p>The resource is valid, but cannot be provided in a format specified in the Accept headers in the request.</p>
<h6 id="407-proxy-authentication-required">407 Proxy authentication required</h6>
<p>Authentication is required with the proxy before requests can be fulfilled.</p>

<h6 id="414-request-uri-too-long">414 Request-URI too long</h6>
<p>The URI provided in the request is too long for the server to process. This is often used when too much data has been encoded into the URI of a GET request and a POST request should be used instead.</p>
<h6 id="415-unsupported-media-type">415 Unsupported media type</h6>
<p>The client provided data with a media type that the server does not support.</p>
<h6 id="416-requested-range-not-satisfiable">416 Requested range not satisfiable</h6>
