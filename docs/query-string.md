#### Query Component of URL

[RFC 3986 Section 3.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4)

The query component contains non-hierarchical data that, along with data in the path component, serves to identify a resource within the scope of the URI's scheme and naming authority (if any).  

The query component is indicated by the first question mark ("?") character and terminated by a number sign ("#") character or by the end of the URI.


The characters slash ("/") and question mark ("?") may represent data within the query component.

#### Query Component Example

`http://api.walmartlabs.com/v1/search?query=chromebook&format=json&apiKey=AKey12345`

The query string here start after the `?` character

So in this query you have the following pairs that are separated by the `&` delimiter:

1. `query=chromebook`
2. `format=json`
3. `apiKey=AKey12345`

#### HTML Web Forms

[Web Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms)

When a HTML Form is submitted the content of the form is encoded as follows:

`field1=value1&field2=value2&field3=value3...`

The query string is composed of a series of field-value pairs.

Within each pair, the field name and value are separated by an equals sign, '='.

The series of pairs is separated by the ampersand, '&' (or semicolon, ';' for URLs embedded in HTML and not generated by a `<form>...</form>`.
