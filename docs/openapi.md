#### What is OpenAPI

> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

> An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.

#### Difference between OpenAPI and Swagger

[Swagger Blogpost](https://swagger.io/blog/api-strategy/difference-between-swagger-and-openapi/)

*OpenAPI is the official specification*

*Swagger are the combined tools for implementing the specification*

The OpenAPI is the official name of the specification.

The development of the specification is fostered by the OpenAPI Initiative, which involves more the 30 organizations from different areas of the tech world — including Microsoft, Google, IBM, and CapitalOne. Smartbear Software, which is the company that leads the development of the Swagger tools, is also a member of the OpenAPI Initiative, helping lead the evolution of the specification.

Swagger is the name associated with some of the most well-known, and widely used tools for implementing the OpenAPI specification. The Swagger toolset includes a mix of open source, free, and commercial tools, which can be used at different stages of the API lifecycle.

#### Swagger Tools

*List of Swagger Tools:*

* [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/):
  * Swagger Editor lets you edit OpenAPI specifications in YAML inside your browser and to preview documentations in real time.

* [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/):
  * Swagger UI is a collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation from an OAS-compliant API.

* [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/):
  * Swagger Codegen allows generation of API client libraries (SDK generation), server stubs and documentation automatically given an OpenAPI Spec.

* [Swagger Parser](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-parser):
  * Swagger Parser is a standalone library for parsing OpenAPI definitions from Java
Swagger Core: Java-related libraries for creating, consuming, and working with OpenAPI definitions

* [Swagger Inspector (free)](https://inspector.swagger.io):
  * Swagger Inspector is an API testing tool that lets you validate your APIs & generate OpenAPI definitions from an existing API

* [SwaggerHub (free and commercial)](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/):
  * SwaggerHub is an API design and documentation tool, built for teams working with OpenAPI.
