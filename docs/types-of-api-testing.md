#### Types of API Testing

[Types of API Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API_testing#Types_of_API_testing)

API testing typically involves the following practices:

* Unit testing - Testing the functionality of individual operations.

* Functional testing - Testing the functionality of broader scenarios, often using unit tests as building blocks for end-to-end tests. Includes test case definition, execution, validation, and regression testing.

* Load testing - Validating functionality and performance under load, often by reusing functional test cases.

* Runtime error detection - Monitoring an application the execution of automated or manual tests to expose problems such as race conditions, exceptions, and resource leaks.

* Security testing - Includes penetration testing and fuzz testing as well as validating authentication, encryption, and access control.

* Web UI testing - Performed as part of end-to-end integration tests that also cover APIs, enables teams to validate GUI items in the context of the larger transaction.
